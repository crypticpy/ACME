# ACME Cultural Funding Analysis 2025 - Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-19

## üìä Project Completion Summary
- **Overall Progress**: 60% COMPLETE ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Critical Issue**: Current LLM analysis is superficial - mixing all questions together
- **Working Features**: Basic pipeline runs, but analysis quality needs improvement
- **LLM Status**: Using GPT-4o but NOT doing proper question-by-question analysis
- **What's Missing**: Deep analysis, proper feature extraction, question-specific insights

## üî¥ Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. **Shallow LLM Analysis**
- Current implementation combines ALL text responses into one pool
- Only samples 500 out of 10,588 responses 
- Loses question context completely
- Cannot distinguish between "barriers" vs "improvements" vs "new ideas"

### 2. **Missing Question-Specific Analysis**
- 18 distinct survey questions with different intents
- Each should be analyzed separately to preserve meaning
- Current approach treats all text as homogeneous

### 3. **Incomplete Feature Extraction**
- Not extracting features from individual responses
- No sentiment analysis per response
- No stakeholder classification with confidence scores
- Missing urgency/priority scoring

## Completed Components

### 1. Project Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive directory structure for analysis and microsite
- Set up Git repository with proper `.gitignore`
- Created professional README with project overview

### 2. Python Analysis Pipeline ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Working Components ‚úÖ
- **Data Ingestion Module**
  - `DataLoader`: Loads Excel files successfully
  - `DataValidator`: Basic validation with quality metrics
  - 1,187 survey responses loaded correctly
  
- **Basic Quantitative Analysis (WHO)**
  - Simple counts and percentages
  - Share of voice categories (Creative, Community, Organizational)
  - Confidence intervals using Wilson score
  
- **Infrastructure**
  - `AuditLogger`: Audit trail system works
  - LLM caching system functional
  - Configuration management with Pydantic

#### Broken/Inadequate Components ‚ùå
- **Qualitative Analysis (WHAT)**
  - Mixes all questions together (MAJOR FLAW)
  - Only samples 500 of 10,588 responses
  - No question-specific analysis
  - No individual response feature extraction
  - Themes lack proper evidence/quotes
  
- **LLM Integration**
  - Makes single batch calls instead of systematic analysis
  - No structured extraction per response
  - Missing sentiment analysis per response
  - No stakeholder classification

### 3. Visualization & Reporting ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Working Components ‚úÖ
- Executive report generator creates Word documents
- Basic visualization module structure exists
- Data export to microsite works

#### Issues ‚ùå
- Visualizations based on flawed analysis data
- No question-specific visualizations
- Missing cross-tabulation insights
- Limited interactive features

### 4. React Microsite ‚úÖ
- Modern React/Next.js setup complete
- TypeScript interfaces defined
- Data loading hooks implemented
- D3.js visualization components created
- **Note**: Microsite is fine, but displays flawed analysis data

## What Actually Works vs What Needs Fixing

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure (Working Well)
- Data loading and validation
- LLM caching system  
- Basic pipeline structure
- Microsite framework
- Report generation framework

### ‚ùå Analysis Quality (Needs Complete Rework)
- **Current**: Mixes all 10,588 text responses together
- **Needed**: Analyze each of 18 questions separately
- **Current**: Random sampling of 500 responses
- **Needed**: Process ALL responses systematically
- **Current**: Single LLM call for theme extraction
- **Needed**: Multi-pass analysis with feature extraction

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Working
- Visualizations work but show flawed data
- Report generates but contains shallow insights
- Microsite displays data but it's not meaningful

## How to Run Current Analysis

1. **Setup Environment**
```bash
cd analysis
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
poetry install
```

2. **Copy Data Files**
Place the Excel files from NEW_Data into:
- `analysis/data/raw/` (will be auto-copied if missing)

3. **Run Full Analysis** (Recommended)
```bash
# Run complete analysis with caching (10-15 minutes)
./run_full_analysis.sh

# Or run directly:
poetry run python run_analysis.py check-config  # Verify setup
poetry run python run_analysis.py run-analysis  # Run pipeline
```

4. **View Results**
Results are saved to:
- `analysis/data/results/session_*/` - Analysis results
- `analysis/data/llm_cache/` - Cached LLM responses (reusable)
- `analysis/data/audit/` - Full traceability logs
- `analysis/logs/` - Run logs

**Note**: The analysis uses caching, so subsequent runs will be much faster.
All LLM responses are saved to disk for complete traceability.

## Critical Next Steps

### 1. **Implement Question-by-Question Deep Analysis**
- Build new analysis module that processes each question separately
- Extract features from EVERY response (not samples)
- Implement multi-pass LLM analysis
- Store all extracted features in structured format

### 2. **Create Proper Feature Extraction Pipeline**
- Response-level sentiment analysis
- Stakeholder classification with confidence
- Theme extraction with evidence quotes
- Urgency/priority scoring
- Cross-question pattern detection

### 3. **Rebuild Visualizations with Real Insights**
- Question-specific visualizations
- Cross-tabulation analysis
- Stakeholder comparison views
- Program-specific deep dives

## Data Files Status
- ‚úÖ Survey data loaded: 1,187 responses across 18 questions
- ‚úÖ Working document loaded: 1,395 feedback entries
- ‚ùå Proper analysis: NOT DONE

## Important Note
The current implementation takes shortcuts that compromise analysis quality. A complete rework of the qualitative analysis module is required to meet PhD-level research standards. See PROJECT_PLAN.md for detailed implementation plan.
