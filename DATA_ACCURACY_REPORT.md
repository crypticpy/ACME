# Data Accuracy Report: Correcting the Narrative

## Key Issue Identified
We've been presenting raw mention counts instead of percentages of unique respondents, which overstates the prevalence of issues.

## Accurate Data Presentation Guidelines

### 1. Transportation/Parking Analysis
**Previous (Incorrect)**: "5,856 transportation barriers"
**Accurate**: "62.3% of respondents (740 people) face transportation/parking barriers"

**Key Insights**:
- Transportation is the 2nd most cited barrier (after cost at 65%)
- Some ZIP codes show 100% of residents facing this barrier
- Geographic analysis reveals "transportation deserts"

### 2. Cultural Funding Themes
**Issue**: Theme counts exceed respondent count (1,351 mentions from 1,187 respondents)
**Solution**: Need to recalculate as % of unique respondents mentioning each theme

**Recommended Approach**:
- Count each respondent only once per theme
- Present as: "X% of respondents called for [theme]"
- Show both percentage and raw number for transparency

### 3. Geographic Analysis Opportunities
With 97.5% ZIP code coverage, we can create:
- Heat maps showing barrier intensity by area
- ZIP-level recommendations for targeted interventions
- District-level analysis for Council presentations

### 4. Top Barriers by Respondent Percentage
1. Cost of tickets/admission: 65.0% (771 respondents)
2. Transportation/parking: 62.3% (740 respondents)
3. Lack of awareness: 51.9% (616 respondents)
4. Location - lack of nearby venues: 41.5% (493 respondents)
5. Limited diversity/representation: 34.0% (403 respondents)

## Recommended Story Framework

### For Each Finding:
1. **Lead with percentage** of respondents affected
2. **Provide context** (ranking among all issues)
3. **Show geographic variation** where relevant
4. **Connect to systemic issues** (Gartner findings)
5. **Propose targeted solutions**

### Example Narrative:
"Nearly two-thirds (62.3%) of Austin's creative community face transportation barriers to cultural participationâ€”making it the second most significant obstacle after cost. Geographic analysis reveals transportation deserts in certain ZIP codes where 85-100% of residents cannot access cultural events. This demands immediate, ZIP-code-specific interventions including enhanced transit partnerships and equitable parking solutions."

## Action Items
1. Recalculate all themes as % of unique respondents
2. Create geographic heat maps for key barriers
3. Update microsite with accurate percentages
4. Add methodology notes for transparency
5. Develop ZIP-level recommendation framework
