"As a long-time, local artist, I sometimes feel that the city’s current cultural focus prioritizes artists who fit into narratives of external hardship or underrepresented demographics—often leaving those of us who are older, rooted in Austin, and steadily working in the arts feeling overlooked. While I deeply support diverse representation, this shift can make it harder for local, established artists to feel included or valued in current arts initiatives.",1,0.1,0.1

"It has become more difficult to get to anything in the city- and I live in deep eddy!   I’m still very sick over the loss of threadgills, shady grove, and other small venues we don’t have near enough spread across the city- it’s all moving east and also dominated by younger generation.   We need blues clubs jazz clubs bluegrass etc.   west of Lamar there is a cultural desert.   Never anything west of Mopac.    No safe way to bike across Mopac either.  What happened to our big annual Art City Austin?   You should buy back shady grove from evil developers that have left it as a sad eye sore.   You should start some live music ideas that are mobile and encourage zero traffic music and art walks for all ages.    Buy up property and encourage more art events and music spaces for local musicians like we used to have.   It’s really just sad that Art City Austin just disappeared .   As big a city as ATX has become we have a lack of art festivals.   Can you not buy back shady grove",1,0.1,0.1

"Generally, I attend inexpensive to free events. There are plenty of them. But when I want to see a concert at a major venue, the tickets are generally too expensive. I also find it frustrating that so many non-profit events end up being fundraisers. While I want to help and do make donations, it feels like it’s mostly artists and creatives attending, so basically those who aren’t earning much are giving to our own community because our community is not being supported. Finding free time is also a barrier. It’s hard to earn enough money in this city as a non-salaried worker and also have time to get out for fun. I don’t get out for much of the free events, unless it’s visual arts-related and basically part of my need to network.",1,0.1,0.1
