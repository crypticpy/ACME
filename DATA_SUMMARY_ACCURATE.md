## Data Methodology Notes

### How Percentages Were Calculated

2. **Funding theme percentages**: Unique respondents mentioning theme รท total respondents
3. **Demographic percentages**: Category selections รท total respondents (can exceed 100%)

### Important Clarifications
- Each respondent counted only once per theme/barrier
- Multiple choice questions allowed multiple selections
- Open-ended responses analyzed for keyword presence
- Geographic analysis based on self-reported ZIP codes

## Comparison: Original vs. Corrected Analysis

The original analysis showed theme percentages based on distribution of mentions (how often themes appeared relative to each other). The corrected analysis shows what percentage of respondents mentioned each theme.

Example:
- Original: "Increase Funding Awareness" = 39.9% of all theme mentions
- Corrected: "Increase Funding Awareness" = 26.8% of respondents

## Next Steps for Analysis

1. **Geographic Heat Maps**: Create ZIP-level visualizations of barriers
2. **Cross-tabulation**: Analyze how barriers vary by respondent type
3. **Program-Specific**: Deep dive into feedback for each funding program
4. **Longitudinal**: Compare with previous years if data available
5. **Action Mapping**: Connect specific feedback to actionable improvements

## Key Takeaways

1. **Two-thirds face cost and transportation barriers** - These are the most pressing issues
2. **One-quarter want better communication** - Awareness is a major gap
3. **One-quarter want simpler applications** - Process complexity is a barrier
4. **One-fifth want transparency and equity** - Trust and fairness matter
5. **Geographic variation exists** - Solutions may need neighborhood-specific approaches

This data provides a clear roadmap for improving Austin's cultural funding programs based on community feedback.
