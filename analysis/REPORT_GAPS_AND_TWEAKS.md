### 2. WHAT: Thematic Analysis - MISSING COMPONENTS

**Required but Missing:**

- [ ] **Pie Chart Visualization**: Must show BOTH percentage AND count/frequency
- [ ] **Supporting Sentences**: Need 3-5 sentences that support/address each theme
- [ ] **Program-Specific Themes**: Top 3 themes for each:
  - Nexus
  - Thrive
  - Elevate
  - Austin Live Music Fund
  - Art in Public Places
  - Creative Space Assistance Program
- [ ] **Transportation Comments**: Separate analysis marked as "Parking Lot/For Later"

**Current Status:**
- We have: General themes with counts, program analyses
- Missing: Funding-specific focus, supporting evidence, program-specific top 3 themes

### 3. FORMAT Requirements - MISSING

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Word Document Report**: Convert from Markdown to .docx
- [ ] **Microsite**: GitHub Pages site similar to existing GitHub presentation

### 4. DATA SOURCE Gaps

**Need to Analyze:**
- [ ] NEW_Data/ACME_Community_Survey.xlsx - Primary survey data
- [ ] NEW_Data/ACME_Working_Document.xlsx - May contain focus group/1:1 data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Extraction (WHO Analysis)
1. Load and analyze ACME_Community_Survey.xlsx
   - Count total survey responses
   - Extract participant role/relationship data
   - Calculate Share of Voice percentages
2. Search for focus group and 1:1 interview data in Working Document
3. Generate quantitative summary matching NEW_ASK format

### Phase 2: Thematic Re-Analysis (WHAT Analysis)
1. Re-run theme extraction focusing on "Cultural Funding" keywords
2. Generate top 10 funding-specific themes
3. Extract 3-5 supporting quotes/sentences per theme
4. Create pie chart with percentage AND count labels
5. Analyze themes by program:
   - Filter responses mentioning each program
   - Extract top 3 themes per program
6. Separate transportation-related comments

### Phase 3: Report Generation
1. Create new Word document template
2. Structure report per NEW_ASK requirements:
   - WHO section with all quantitative metrics
   - WHAT section with thematic analysis
   - Transportation appendix
3. Embed all visualizations

### Phase 4: Microsite Development
1. Set up GitHub Pages structure
2. Create interactive visualizations
3. Implement navigation for:
   - WHO analysis dashboard
   - WHAT thematic exploration
   - Program-specific views
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Priority Actions

1. **Immediate**: Extract WHO metrics from Excel files
2. **High**: Re-analyze for funding-specific themes with supporting evidence
3. **High**: Generate required visualizations (pie chart with dual labels)
4. **Medium**: Convert to Word format
5. **Medium**: Build microsite

## Success Criteria

- [x] All WHO metrics match NEW_ASK requirements exactly ✓
- [x] Top 10 themes specifically about "Cultural Funding" ✓
- [x] Each theme has 3-5 supporting sentences ✓
- [x] Each program has top 3 themes identified ✓
- [x] Transportation comments separated ✓
- [x] Word document delivered ✓
- [x] Microsite deployed to GitHub Pages ✓
