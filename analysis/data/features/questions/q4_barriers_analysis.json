  "key_insights": [
    "Financial barriers are the most frequently cited and urgent obstacle, with multiple themes related to affordability and economic access scoring high on urgency (up to 1.00) and representing a significant portion of overall feedback.",
    "Insufficient funding for arts and culture organizations is a critical systemic issue, with high urgency scores (up to 0.96), indicating that both individuals and organizations are struggling to access necessary resources.",
    "Transportation and parking challenges, while less frequently mentioned, are persistent barriers with moderate urgency, particularly affecting those without reliable access to transit or affordable parking.",
    "A lack of awareness about available arts, culture, music, and entertainment opportunities is a recurring theme, suggesting that communication and outreach gaps are limiting participation.",
    "High urgency scores across financial and funding-related themes indicate that these barriers disproportionately affect lower-income residents, potentially exacerbating inequities in cultural participation."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Expand targeted subsidy or sliding-scale programs to reduce financial barriers for individuals and families, prioritizing those with demonstrated need to ensure equitable access to arts, culture, music, and entertainment events.",
    "Increase municipal funding and grant opportunities for local arts and culture organizations, with a focus on supporting initiatives that directly address affordability and access for underserved communities.",
    "Collaborate with transit agencies and event organizers to improve transportation options, such as discounted transit passes, dedicated shuttle services, or partnerships for event-specific routes, and address parking challenges through shared-use agreements or subsidized parking.",
    "Develop and implement a comprehensive outreach and communications strategy, leveraging multiple platforms and community networks to raise awareness of available cultural opportunities, particularly in underrepresented neighborhoods.",
    "Establish a regular feedback mechanism with community members and stakeholders to monitor the effectiveness of implemented measures and to identify emerging barriers, ensuring that solutions remain responsive and data-driven."
