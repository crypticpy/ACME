    "A significant portion of respondents (29.3%) identified high-urgency issues, with insufficient funding and resource allocation standing out as the most urgent concerns (urgency scores: 0.96 and 0.86, respectively).",
    "Complexity in the application process and administrative burden, while less frequently mentioned, are associated with relatively high urgency, indicating that process improvements could have a meaningful impact for applicants.",
    "Equity in cultural funding remains a notable concern, with respondents highlighting the need for fairer distribution of resources (urgency score: 0.83).",
    "There is a persistent lack of awareness and visibility around cultural funding programs, as evidenced by multiple mentions of outreach, promotion, and awareness-related issues.",

    "Increase overall funding allocations for cultural programs, prioritizing areas identified as under-resourced, to address the most urgent concerns of insufficient funding and resource allocation.",
    "Simplify the application process and reduce administrative burdens by streamlining forms and providing clear, accessible guidelines, making it easier for a broader range of applicants to participate.",
    "Implement targeted outreach and promotional campaigns, including multilingual materials and direct engagement with underserved communities, to raise awareness of available funding opportunities.",
    "Establish transparent equity criteria and reporting mechanisms to ensure fair distribution of funds, with regular reviews to assess and adjust allocations based on community needs.",
    "Develop ongoing community engagement initiatives (e.g., information sessions, feedback forums) to both inform potential applicants and gather continuous input for program improvement."
