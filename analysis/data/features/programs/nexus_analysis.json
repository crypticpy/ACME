    "The Nexus and Elevate grants are a headache to document, particularly the close-out and making sure all the exact verbiage/logos are included in all promotions",
    "More funding, more opportunties, bigger budgets (AIPP, NEXUS, Elevate)",
    "Grants for visual art shows, installations and murals without such narrow guidelines and haphazard grading systems like nexus",
    "The requirement to already have a venue or a booked exhibition for Nexus grants, rather than supporting the development of work by individual artists regardless of if there is a scheduled exhibition",
    "The length of time to fulfill the NEXUS",
    "This gives emerging artists an opportunity (such as Nexus) and more experienced artists strive for large projects",
    "I attended an informative session on the Nexus grant in Spanish, and the presenter's lack of proficiency in Spanish was offensive to me",
    "For example, with Nexus funding the city has not been timely in notifying applicants which has impacted their ability to even execute the projects that they applied for in the first place",
    "Grants for artists outside of music akin to NEXUS/City of Austin musician grants (which are a great step in the right direction! Please keep them going!)",
    "I think the three levels of grant applications (Nexus, Thrive and Elevate) are acceptable based on funding"
