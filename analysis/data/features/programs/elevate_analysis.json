    "The Nexus and Elevate grants are a headache to document, particularly the close-out and making sure all the exact verbiage/logos are included in all promotions",
    "Keep funding the arts! We are honored to be recipients of the Elevate Grant the past two years",
    "Long form interviews, artist talks, conferences, and events that continue to elevate the conversation to make Austin a respected art city on par with LA and NYC while keeping the doors open to all",
    "Based on the current budgetary policies of CAD grants like Elevate, organizations are actually discouraged to collaborate and share resources (financial capital, host collaborative events, etc",
    "More funding, more opportunties, bigger budgets (AIPP, NEXUS, Elevate)",
    "ACME can serve as a megaphone by creating platforms, both digital and physical, that elevate their work",
    "Also, I would like to see greatly improved applications (particularly for Elevate) that are more arts oriented and less like a social services application",
    "By removing barriers to funding, creating spaces for collaboration, and providing platforms to elevate cultural leaders, ACME can help strengthen Austin\u2019s creative ecosystem as a whole",
    "Support through the Elevate program has made it possible for us to grow, increase pay for musicians and artists (100% local to Austin), and more than double our audience reach",
    "More programs or opportunities for youth to be involved and elevate their work"
