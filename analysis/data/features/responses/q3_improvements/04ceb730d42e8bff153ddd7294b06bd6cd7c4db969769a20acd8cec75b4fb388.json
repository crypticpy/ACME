    "I am not sure the Long Center is very effective at managing the application and money distribution part",
    "The application portal should be more user friendly! User centered design at the forefront",
    "Panel process and training needs quite a bit of refinement",
    "Thrive should all be the same panelists, having completely separate panel groups scoring for the same competitive grant is rife with discrepancies",
    "Panelist training on equity (especially economic equity issues within Austin) and local conditions needs to be CENTRAL",
    "Fiscal Sponsorship is a GREAT resource and should be optional but NOT required",
