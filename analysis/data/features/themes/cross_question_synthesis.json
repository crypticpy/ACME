This systemic intervention will lower barriers to entry and ensure that new and diverse voices are supported, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic cultural ecosystem."

This addresses the root issue of undervaluation and underpayment, and ensures that creative professionals can sustainably contribute to Austin's cultural life."
