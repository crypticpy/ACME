### Strategic Insight
Establish a sustainable, equity-focused funding model that prioritizes both the
overall increase in available resources and addresses persistent underfunding.
By tying funding allocations to clear equity metrics, the city can ensure that
historically marginalized and emerging artists receive proportionate support,
directly addressing the root cause of insufficient funding and resource
allocation.

### Call to Action
The Austin creative community has spoken with remarkable clarity. They need more than incremental improvementsâ€”they need transformative change in how cultural funding is allocated, distributed, and accessed. The time for bold action is now.

### Recommended Next Steps
