      "Experienced leadership and panelists in literary arts. \nA safeguard system for review when scores are irregular, which might be a red flag for a bigger issue during the panel process. \nMore transparency in the process from design to implementation. \nExtended multi-year funding (longer than 2 years for Thrive) for small to medium-sized organizations growing to institution status. ",
      "I would like to see these programs become more accessible and equitable, not less. ACME's proposed changes to the current funding structure would be detrimental to Austin organizations and artists. The proposal to instate a 50% match, a required year off from funding, funding caps based on the organization's operating budget, and requirement to either be a nonprofit or fiscally sponsored to receive funding are all greatly prohibitive to equitable access. Reintroducing these outdated grant practices would, essentially, remove funding from the majority of organizations and artists who are currently building capacity thanks to these new programs, and put it in the hands of the few large institutions who already dominate the scene. I believe this would be more detrimental to organizations like ours than if we had never received the funding at all, as we would be forced to lay off staff, cut programming, and decrease hourly pay for artists. I urge you to pause this anonymous working group, and connect with the community before moving your suggestions forward to Council. ",
      "Application criteria and wording in the application/eligibility materials that encourages organizations serving multiple racial/ethnic demographics (rather than a singular racial/ethnic demographic) to apply for funding, especially if the organization is providing equitable services on the basis of very real inequities, such as age, disability, and/or income. For example, organizations that provide meaningful educational arts, music, or dance classes to low-income populations, whose demographics may or may not be tied to a single majority ethnic or racial identity and who, because of economic disadvantages, may not be able to access these programs otherwise. As of now, the grant\u2019s language (regarding eligibility, application questions, and the rubric) is structured so that it favors organizations serving a singular racial/ethnic identity established by founders representing a singular racial/ethnic identity. But other inequalities, such as poverty, age, and/or disability, impact all racial/ethnic identities. Can organizations addressing these important issues also qualify for this grant? And if this is too far from the intent of the cultural funding grants, can we rethink the allocation of city funding so that there are other opportunities to support the broad spectrum of arts organizations doing important work in our community?\n\n________\nSpace/Venue Support: Is there a way that the grant could automatically include waiver of the space rental fees for a COA venue? If grant recipients wish to hold their events in a city venue, they are essentially paying for use of city facilities with city funding. \n\n_______\nMarketing Support: Is there a way the grant could automatically include waiver of the fees associated with paid promotional marketing packages through VisitAustin? The required calendar listing on VisitAustin website doesn\u2019t necessarily provide a significant impact in the marketing visibility for awardees\u2019 activities. To get beneficial visibility on the VisitAustin platform, you need to sign up for one of the paid promotional packages. As it stands now, if grant recipients wish to get the most benefit from this platform, they are essentially required to use city funding to pay for services from a city-funded organization.\n\n_________\nAvailability of city venues: Is there a way grant recipients can have more equitable access (and perhaps even given more priority) to being able to schedule their events in city venues? As of now, you cannot reserve venues controlled by Austin Parks and Rec more than six months in advance, which is a huge limitation to planning/marketing/promotion of tourism events. And Palmer Events Center is nearly unattainable with the amount of events that are scheduled there, now especially with the closure of Austin Convention Center.  (BTW-Did you know the same Vintage/Garage Sale event has reserved large hall space at Palmer Events Center one weekend out of every single month for at least the past 12 consecutive months and into the next year? This recurring event, with little value in terms of representing the Austin arts and creative community as it focuses on the re-sell of secondhand goods, prevents other organizations from being able to host their events at one of the most affordable large venues in Austin. Since this is a city-owned, taxpayer-funded space, should there perhaps be a limit on the number of weekends the same event/organization can reserve this space?)",

      "Literary arts are the least funded of the arts locally and nationally. Torch Literary Arts supports Black women writers and the larger literary community as a global resource and destination rooted in Austin, TX. Black feminist led and serving nonprofits receive less than half of one percent of global funding. A third of our community members report annual household incomes of less than $25,000. 75% of publishing and literary organizations are white and on the East Coast. This means without local sustained access to literary organizations that meet the creative and professional needs of Black women writers, our voices and literary contributions are under threat of erasure in Austin.  ",
      "Honestly, threats to our funding like ACME's proposed changes to the CAD structure is our biggest concern right now. If Austin wants to be the progressive city that we claim to be, it would continue to support arts organizations amid the federal and state cuts to funding that are threatening our existence. Having to advocate to keep the support that we were given is a tremendous barrier to the daily work that we need to do to run our organization and create art for Austin. I hope that ACME leadership can back track this proposal, and become accessible to the community. ",
      "- access to affordable space\n- excessive fees and stipulations to book city-owned venues \n- For example, why is it not allowed (and we were told non-negotiable) to use catering options outside the exclusive in-house catering business $$$ at Palmer Events Center? Their prices are congruent with those of a five-star hotel, with a far more limited menu. These are the types of rates and requirements that prevent many smaller local organizations from being able to access and make use of these city-owned spaces effectively.\n- Another example: Did you know that booking space at city-owned recreation centers costs more than $200 per hour? On top of the flat, non-negotiable hourly rate of $155 per hour, fees for additional staff, custodial services, and utilities are added at the discretion of the venue. This makes rental rates higher than private venues in some cases.\n- Another example of lack of access: Certain city-owned spaces, categorized as special event spaces (e.g. the Pavilion near Fiesta Gardens), have caps on the number of events that can be hosted there each year. Therefore, the space lies vacant most of the year, and the events that are hosted are already \"grandfathered\" in as one of the limited number of \"special events\" that can take place there. There is no way to reserve and host an event in these spaces, even small events that wouldn't have nearly the number of attendees as one of the prioritized larger special events. This blocks smaller organizations from accessing some of the most flexible and affordable city-owned spaces in Austin.\n",
