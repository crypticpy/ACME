  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_414\nResponse Text: The funding programs for Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive should be reconsidered and redesigned, from my perspective.  They are no longer equitable and the changes that we have seen in the last 5 years have been detrimental to artists and arts organizations alike.  I my opinion, the department's attempts at creating an exclusive funding program that targeted distinct groups (POC, LBTGQ) has now discriminated against valuable organizations that have served as cornerstones in this city - some of whom closed their doors as a result of these changes. \n\nDisability is deemed a value in the new programming, but do the math and you will find that the number of organizations that are purely serving people with disabilities is not equitably funded as compared to the total funding. It is less than 1% and less than 4 organizations are funded this year - last cylce only 1 organization was funded. This exclusive funding model prioritizes color, race, and LBTGQ over disability - making it such that the disability organization had to also check the box for cultural race priority and/or an LTBGQ priority. Focusing on the disability priority was not enough - even though these organizations were the only orgs that were actually serving Austin's resident pool, over 167,000 people with disabilites.  For the LTBGQ organization, that was not the case - they did not have to serve specific people of color nor did they need to serve a disability population.  Essentially, the program was designed too far from the center of the spectrum and it no longer serves the needs of our broader arts organizations and artists. \n\nThe panel process should also be considered for re-design. As an applicant you listen to panelists speak about your project and they share misinformation with other panelists. The applicant has no voice to correct their errors.  Panelsts from out of town are summarizing our projects to the group and applicants must endure and hope for the best. If panelists are selected to check boxes on equity, then they should likely be assigned to special applicants (LBTQG panelist to LBTQG applicants, panelists w/ disabilities to disability applicants) so that the applicants have a fairer chance of being represented.  Antoher option is to ask applicants to create a paragraph to represent their application to the panelist - one that is read by the primary reviewer. This at least allows the applicant to say what is important and reduces errors presented by the panelists.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
