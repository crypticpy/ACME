  "prompt": "Question: What kinds of programs or services would you like ACME to offer that currently do not exist or are underrepresented?\n\nResponse ID: resp_3268\nResponse Text: To truly meet the needs of Austin\u2019s diverse creative communities, ACME should consider launching or expanding the following underrepresented programs and services:\n\nCultural Equity Accelerator Program: A capacity-building initiative for BIPOC-led and grassroots arts organizations, offering mentorship, technical assistance, and multi-year funding to scale impact sustainably.\n\nCreative Space Bank: A centralized platform that connects artists and organizations with available, affordable venues, rehearsal spaces, and pop-up locations across the city.\n\nMobile Arts & Culture Units: Traveling stages, galleries, and studios that bring programming directly into underserved neighborhoods, schools, and public housing communities.\n\nYouth Arts Leadership Fellowship: A paid program that empowers young creatives to lead community-based projects, receive mentorship, and gain experience in cultural planning and advocacy.\n\nPermit & Production Support Hub: A one-stop service center that helps artists and small organizations navigate permitting, insurance, and event logistics\u2014reducing barriers to public activation.\n\nCreative Wellness & Sustainability Fund: Support for mental health, burnout prevention, and long-term career sustainability for artists and cultural workers.\n\nCross-sector Innovation Labs: Programs that bring together artists, urban planners, technologists, and community leaders to co-create solutions for civic and social challenges through the arts.\n\nThese programs would not only fill critical gaps but also position Austin as a national leader in inclusive, community-driven cultural development.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n
