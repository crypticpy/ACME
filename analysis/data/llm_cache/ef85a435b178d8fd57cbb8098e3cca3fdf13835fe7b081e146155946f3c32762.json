  "prompt": "Question: What barriers do you or your community face in accessing support or services related to arts, culture, music and entertainment?\n\nResponse ID: resp_4052\nResponse Text: Most artist/musician/actor will agree that there isn't a moment where you've now got the job that you can just do and stay at that pay level by default like in a regular job. You always have to make something new, promote yourself, do this dance of networking, while making room for day jobs and self-care and family/community care. I, and my community of artists who are mothers, are trying to be seen and acknowledged. Artist parents across the world are joining together in small communities to make studio time possible, to create space for empathy, maybe to share wisdom, definitely to share resources. I was shocked to realize there was nothing like this in Austin, a city where I chose to move back to so I could raise my two daughters. Their childhood was as magical as mine. But I lost out on the mentorship of other artists who were also parents, by not being able to find that community. Because people STiLL say that you can't be a dedicated artist if you choose to have children. They really mean if you are a Woman who chooses to have children (which gets even harder if you're a woman of color or LGBTQIA+. So I'm sure there were plenty of artist moms around town but nobody was going to create an organization and start sharing about it on listservs (precursor to Facebook, yep, I'm that old). I think Guerrilla Girls made some nice art about this kind of stuff: \"When Racism & Sexism are No Longer Fashionable, What will your Art Collection be Worth?\" That one gets to my point, that historically, in the art world, white men have always culturally and financially dominated. Yes, there were and are exceptions. Yes, it has shifted some. And no, it hasn't shifted nearly enough. I think the barrier is one that the majority of us face. It's financially difficult to be creative, to make things that not everyone could afford or may not even know about because it's not a mass produced thing that will be on billboards and in your local store. It's by design meant to be more personal, intimate, ephemeral, maybe even in-person. How do you turn $5,000 into a little magic? Give it to a creative and let them use the full amount to realize a cool project. Don't ask them to also spend part of it on marketing expenses, event planning, event insurance, etc. Don't force them to go through these silly motions so there\u2019s \"proof\" tourist-worthy events are happening. The City could fund smaller versions of ACL, SXSW, Austin Studio Tour, Austin film festival. Through these events, that would be free to the public, they create the space and time for people who got funded to make art, music, film, etc., to come together and show off their creations. It would be like a city-wide talent show 2-4 times a year. This would also give hotels a boost in occupancy at times of year that might slower (heck, maybe the hotels host these events in their event rooms and this could be a partnership/investment in cultural events that cycles back into more HOT tax revenue). The artists would get more attention from these showcases than from their boosted Instagram posts, road signs, and postcards on cork boards at coffee shops. I add that caveat that I\u2019m thinking from the individual artist perspective and NEXUS grant type funding.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
