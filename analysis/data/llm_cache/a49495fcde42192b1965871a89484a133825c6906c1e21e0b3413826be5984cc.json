  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_14\nResponse Text: Application criteria and wording in the application/eligibility materials that encourages organizations serving multiple racial/ethnic demographics (rather than a singular racial/ethnic demographic) to apply for funding, especially if the organization is providing equitable services on the basis of very real inequities, such as age, disability, and/or income. For example, organizations that provide meaningful educational arts, music, or dance classes to low-income populations, whose demographics may or may not be tied to a single majority ethnic or racial identity and who, because of economic disadvantages, may not be able to access these programs otherwise. As of now, the grant\u2019s language (regarding eligibility, application questions, and the rubric) is structured so that it favors organizations serving a singular racial/ethnic identity established by founders representing a singular racial/ethnic identity. But other inequalities, such as poverty, age, and/or disability, impact all racial/ethnic identities. Can organizations addressing these important issues also qualify for this grant? And if this is too far from the intent of the cultural funding grants, can we rethink the allocation of city funding so that there are other opportunities to support the broad spectrum of arts organizations doing important work in our community?\n\n________\nSpace/Venue Support: Is there a way that the grant could automatically include waiver of the space rental fees for a COA venue? If grant recipients wish to hold their events in a city venue, they are essentially paying for use of city facilities with city funding. \n\n_______\nMarketing Support: Is there a way the grant could automatically include waiver of the fees associated with paid promotional marketing packages through VisitAustin? The required calendar listing on VisitAustin website doesn\u2019t necessarily provide a significant impact in the marketing visibility for awardees\u2019 activities. To get beneficial visibility on the VisitAustin platform, you need to sign up for one of the paid promotional packages. As it stands now, if grant recipients wish to get the most benefit from this platform, they are essentially required to use city funding to pay for services from a city-funded organization.\n\n_________\nAvailability of city venues: Is there a way grant recipients can have more equitable access (and perhaps even given more priority) to being able to schedule their events in city venues? As of now, you cannot reserve venues controlled by Austin Parks and Rec more than six months in advance, which is a huge limitation to planning/marketing/promotion of tourism events. And Palmer Events Center is nearly unattainable with the amount of events that are scheduled there, now especially with the closure of Austin Convention Center.  (BTW-Did you know the same Vintage/Garage Sale event has reserved large hall space at Palmer Events Center one weekend out of every single month for at least the past 12 consecutive months and into the next year? This recurring event, with little value in terms of representing the Austin arts and creative community as it focuses on the re-sell of secondhand goods, prevents other organizations from being able to host their events at one of the most affordable large venues in Austin. Since this is a city-owned, taxpayer-funded space, should there perhaps be a limit on the number of weekends the same event/organization can reserve this space?)\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
