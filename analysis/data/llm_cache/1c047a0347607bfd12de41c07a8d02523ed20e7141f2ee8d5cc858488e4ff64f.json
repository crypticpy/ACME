Fix the funding structure for the arts at the City.  But, ACME can also be the driver of collaborations that encourage support among business, foundations, individuals, obviously public officials (to promote many types of support for the arts) to come together to support this critical and struggling industry.  ACME can't provide all the direct support that is needed.  But, it can be the central point for encouraging involvement by others.
