  "prompt": "Question: What kinds of programs or services would you like ACME to offer that currently do not exist or are underrepresented?\n\nResponse ID: resp_3296\nResponse Text: Certain cultural organizations own and operate their own venues, which adds an additional layer of responsibility. These groups must balance the planning and execution of cultural events and festivals with the ongoing maintenance and preservation of their facilities.
