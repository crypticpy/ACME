  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_770\nResponse Text: ACME must evaluate the success and sustainability of the THRIVE program.  Many who have been awarded a grant feel abandoned and/or betrayed when that money is not renewed or available in year 3.  Yet the city can not support 35 groups every year at the $150,000 level forever. It is not possible.  Also for profit groups should not have access to HOT funding.\n  Please be sure to screen so that one organization can not get 4 or 5 grants from THRIVE and Elevate.
