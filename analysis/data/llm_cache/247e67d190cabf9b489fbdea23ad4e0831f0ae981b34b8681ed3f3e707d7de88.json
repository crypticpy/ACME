  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_321\nResponse Text: The number one thing ACME should be doing is positioning the arts as essential infrastructure across all sectors of city life\u2014not just within the cultural sphere. This means leading efforts to integrate the arts into areas like health, housing, transportation, education, and social services. The arts are not separate from these systems; they are powerful tools for public engagement, healing, and systems change.\n\nACME has the chance to make Austin a national leader in cross-sector collaboration by launching innovative, artist-led programs that don\u2019t just support the arts\u2014but use the arts to address core civic challenges. This could include artist residencies in public health departments, creative youth programming co-designed with mental health practitioners, or commissioning public art as part of affordable housing and transit development.\n\nTo make this possible, ACME must also pursue federal and non-arts funding streams\u2014tapping into public health, infrastructure, and community development dollars\u2014and strategically channeling those resources into creative initiatives. By doing so, we redefine what arts funding can be (without solely dependent on HOT) and ensure that creative workers are embedded in the systems that shape our city. This approach doesn\u2019t just benefit artists\u2014it benefits everyone.\n\nTOP 2 outside of above would be: \n\n1. Center Infrastructure\u2014Not Just Events\nIf artists and cultural groups don\u2019t have the space or resources to create, they can\u2019t present their work. No events, no exhibitions, no cultural experiences to fuel local identity or tourism. ACME must prioritize affordable creative space, access to equipment, mentorship, and operational support\u2014ensuring artists can live, work, and stay in Austin. Many long-standing, community-based organizations are being displaced due to rising costs. ACME must advocate for long-term, affordable creative space through partnerships, subsidies, and proactive policy change. How can we better leverage Rally Austin? What would a citywide site survey of vacant, city-owned properties look like for cultural activation? These are the conversations ACME should be leading.\n\n2. Multi-Year Funding for NPOs providing a cultural anchor aka year-round programming: NPOs providing ongoing mentorship, studio access, public events, and educational pipelines need stable, multi-year funding to grow and sustain their impact. This kind of investment allows for strategic planning, staff retention, and deeper community work\u2014and the return is huge: more artists working, more engagement, more revenue, more jobs, and greater civic and cultural vitality. However, this will be null and void if infrastructure is not addressed ASAP.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
