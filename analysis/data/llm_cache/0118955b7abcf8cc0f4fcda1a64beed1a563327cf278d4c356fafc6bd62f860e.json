  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_2683\nResponse Text: Austin has many assets and a pretty decent amount of arts funding compared to other cities.  The problem is that these resources have never been deployed strategically, with an eye on city wide, long term impact.  We need to take a big step back, and make a detailed long range comprehensive plan to maximize assets and funding in accordance with proven practices seen in peer cities who are far more successful with cultural infrastructure and programming.  Austin could be a theater destination, like Minneapolis, creating good paying jobs for actors and all the visual artists, musicians, technicians and everyone it takes to produce theater.  Austin could reinvigorate its recording industry and bring tons of studio work to local musicians, but City investments would need to focus on industry development, as council intended for the Live Music Fund, rather than staff's preference for deploying grants to address historical inequities.  Certainly, those inequities are real, but they will be corrected by creating real work opportunities, not by the City picking winners from among aspiring musicians, while missing the established artists that give Austin's its reputation as a major music city, arbitrarily creating haves and have nots, sowing division and creating new dependence on the City, rather than an opportunity structure that artists and musicians can thrive in as professionals for decades into the future.  Also, consider what else the City government  has control over: our publicly owned utility could offer rebates to venues, Visit Austin could do much more for cultural tourism by offering marketing grants to local venues and festivals , as Houston does, and the film incentives budget could be grown radically.  Film production create jobs in nearly every artistic discipline. The Film Commission should move from Visit Austin to ACME.
