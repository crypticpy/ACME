This would build stronger community ties and expose a wider audience to varied cultural expressions.\nInvest in culturally-specific outreach and capacity building: Recognize and address the unique needs of different cultural groups. This could involve offering grants, workshops, and mentorship tailored to help organizations enhance their operational capacity and reach within their communities.\nAmplify underrepresented voices: Actively seek out and highlight the contributions of cultural leaders and organizations from all backgrounds, ensuring that Austin's rich diversity is fully reflected in the creative landscape.
