  "prompt": "Question: What barriers do you or your community face in accessing support or services related to arts, culture, music and entertainment?\n\nResponse ID: resp_3267\nResponse Text: Our community faces several persistent barriers that limit access to arts, culture, music, and entertainment support:\n\n\u2022 Lack of equitable funding distribution: Many grassroots and BIPOC-led organizations are overlooked in favor of larger, more established institutions. This perpetuates disparities and limits the visibility of diverse cultural expressions.\n\u2022 Limited access to affordable venues and creative spaces: Rising real estate costs and gentrification have displaced many artists and cultural organizations, especially in historically Black and Brown neighborhoods.\n\u2022 Complex and inaccessible application processes: Grant and permit applications are often overly technical, time-consuming, and not designed with smaller or volunteer-run organizations in mind.\n\u2022 Insufficient outreach and communication:\nMany community members are unaware of available programs due to limited marketing, language barriers, and lack of culturally relevant engagement strategies.\n\u2022 High costs and regulatory burdens: Permit fees, insurance requirements, and logistical costs make it difficult for small organizations and independent artists to host events or activate public spaces.\n\u2022 Lack of transportation and geographic equity:\n\nCultural programming is often concentrated in central Austin, leaving out communities in East, South, and North Austin who face mobility and access challenges.\n\nTo truly support Austin's creative ecosystem, we must remove these systemic barriers and invest in inclusive, community-driven solutions that uplift all voices.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease
