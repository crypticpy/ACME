  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_689\nResponse Text: I\u2019m a lifetime resident of Austin (62 years!) and a lifetime supporter of Austin arts and culture, I know  ACME has done an amazing job. But now, shaking things up and looking again at our population and the way our population is changed and growing is really critical to moving forward. The Austin events that I have always enjoyed the most include a wide variety of our population: all ages all sizes all colors. But those events have become too unwieldy, too huge, and many are put off by the sheer size of these programs. As trivial as it might seem to some, transportation and parking is a gigantic barrier to many sub groups in Austin that would like to participate. I\u2019m willing to pay ticket prices if I can get to an event, but sometimes I simply can\u2019t get there. \nI can\u2019t park a long ways away and public transportation does not serve my purpose and if I have to pay for a ticket price and an exorbitant Uber price I\u2019m often prohibited from going to do the things that I absolutely love. I think ACME needs more paid positions in order to support their growing role in a rapidly growing city. The paid positions should become more localized - South Austin North Austin East Austin West Austin, etc.. I don\u2019t think we can any longer behave as one big city. We have got to create venues all over - especially in the current venue-desert areas in town and provide amazing transportation to and from.  I understand that there are very many moving parts here, but ACME can continue to lead and emerge as an even stronger leader in the Austin culture scene with some tweaks and some additional personnel and some very thoughtful expansions. Are you sorry you asked me?
