  "prompt": "Question: What type of cultural arts or entertainment opportunities would you like to see more of in Austin?\n\nResponse ID: resp_821\nResponse Text: There has always been an out-sized focus on film and music, versus the other performing arts, when it comes to funding.  I get that these types of events are bigger money-makers, but that is why theatre, dance, and other live performing arts need more support from the city - not less.  That is not to say that film and music should not be supported, they absolutely should.  But the attempts to siphon money from struggling non-profits to redirect funds to things like SXSW and ACL over the decades I have worked in the arts in Austin are incredibly dispiriting.
