  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1335\nResponse Text: Educate the city council that rubber-stamping real estate development projects and the philosophy them is hurting affordability and opportunities for creative people. (Project Connect is a real estate project with some transportation added. The city could get so much more for so much less, freeing up $$$ for the creative community.
