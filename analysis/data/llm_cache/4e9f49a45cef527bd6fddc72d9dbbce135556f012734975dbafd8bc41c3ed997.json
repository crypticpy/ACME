  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_2341\nResponse Text: 1.\tInclusive Participation in Funding Processes\nWe request that artists and organizations be granted seats on funding committees and be directly involved in the development and planning of funding improvement initiatives. Furthermore, this involvement should not preclude us from also being eligible applicants. It is essential that those impacted by funding decisions have a voice in shaping them.\n2.\tEstablishment of a Heritage Fund\nWe propose the creation of a dedicated \u201cHeritage Fund\u201d to support organizations and artists who have, over the past several decades, played a critical role in reshaping the cultural and artistic landscape of Austin. Many of us initiated outreach, education, and service programs for underserved communities long before equity became a stated goal. Our work has not been limited to symbolic gestures; we have been collaborators, educators, and producers who go directly into marginalized communities\u2014not to profit, but to serve.\n3.\tMentorship Opportunities Over Competition\nWe ask that experienced artists be given the opportunity to mentor emerging artists rather than compete with them for limited funding. This approach would allow for intergenerational knowledge transfer and strengthen the overall artistic community.\n4.\tRecognition Without Penalty\nPlease do not penalize artists for achieving visibility or success. In the United States, it is widely acknowledged that most artists do not earn a living wage unless employed by private institutions or universities. Those of us who remain embedded in underserved communities do so out of commitment\u2014not financial gain. International opportunities we receive are often the result of years of relationship-building and consistent, community-driven work. Such recognition should be viewed as an asset, not a disqualifier.\n5.\tEquitable Access to Space and Resources\nWe urge the city and its partners to ensure affordable\u2014or preferably free\u2014access to rehearsal studios, performance spaces, and other necessary facilities. Discrimination has long-term economic impacts; poverty remains a barrier to artistic development and access. While not all artists are suited for outreach or education work, those who are\u2014and have demonstrated this capacity\u2014should receive institutional support to expand their impact and train others in community-based practices.\nIn conclusion, I would call for a funding system that honors legacy, supports sustainability, and fosters collaboration.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
