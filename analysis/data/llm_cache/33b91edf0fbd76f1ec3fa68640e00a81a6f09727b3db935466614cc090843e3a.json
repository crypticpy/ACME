  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_338\nResponse Text: \u2022 Find ways to have lived experience expressed narratively in the application (which can influence score among enlightened panelists/evaluators), but not as an exclusionary eligibility threshold as it was in the pilot.\n\n\u2022 Write new guidelines to obtain enlightened panelists WHO HAVE ARTS EXPERTISE in the particular specialty being evaluated.\n\n\u2022 Audience served must be the PRIMARY scoring factor. This is public money, so it should be used for the public good. Gathering specifics about this will also help ACME with hard data to proclaim economic impact of the arts.\n\n\u2022 FINAL REPORTS must be detailed, provide links to legitimate backup, and must ALL be incorporated into impact summaries. With only 10% of final reports now reviewed, we are losing the data to help us proclaim economic impact. This is an example of a shocking logic gap and lack of initiative in the programs as run by EDD. IF IT TAKES AN ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE TO DO COMPLETE FINAL REPORT SUMMARY WORK, THAT'S A GREAT USE OF A POSITION. That position should NOT be a third-party administrator. It is the very soul of the work: HOW DID THE FUNDING IMPACT AUSTIN AUDIENCES? \u2014 with data to back it up! \n\n\u2022 Artistic merit must be restored as the SECONDARY scoring consideration to honor the public investment.\n\n\u2022 The TERTIARY scoring consideration should be ARTISTS PAID. How much? How many? The more artists paid well, the higher the grant allowance should be. \n\n\u2022 Incorporate a professionalizing pipeline structure for all arts grants - something like emerging, developing, institutional, featured...?) to point all applicants toward growth and professionalization. \n\n\u2022 LARGE grants should be reserved for groups with the capacity already in place to manage them according to best practices \u2014 to protect public investment/good stewardship of public funds. Incorporate inverse proportionality for institutional-level funding \u2014 i.e., the % of allowable budget funded by City dollars goes down as growth happens. This requires larger orgs to grow healthfully -- diversifying fundraising, finding corporate investment partners, and conducting business plan optimizations \u2014 to keep the city from giving more and more as they grow and grow forever. Yet, it enables institutional orgs to continue to receive funding at some level no matter how big they get. \n\n\u2022 Conversely, emerging artists/groups should be funded in amounts commensurate w/ their development and capacity to manage the investment well (let's articulate how to measure that capacity)\n\n\u2022 Institutions that support the whole ecosystem should receive appropriate support\n\n\u2022 Arts Services institutions can be strategic extensions of ACME effectiveness if partnerships are clear and developed with intention according to expertise. They can set applicants up for more successful use of granted funds. For example:\n- TALA can teach GAAP \u2014 or help with implementation \u2014 for applicants to reach improved capacity\n- Fiscal Sponsors must meet minimum standards established by the National Network of Fiscal Sponsors\n- Create official collaborations between ACME Marketing and subsector arts services groups to streamline info consolidation for automated public consumption. Visit Austin can be a component, but not the owner of this. Visit Austin is not collaborative. Nor does it serve Austinites well.\n\n\u2022 We should build a mechanism to ATTRACT businesses into making arts philanthropy a priority. THIS MAY NEED TO BE A NEW CITY hobnobbing/nonprofit imposition. Hydrate Austin's philanthropic desert.\n\n\u2022 Creative spaces need City support and coordination. SpaceFinder-type searchable public database for clear pricing and easy booking accessible to all. Database should be managed by a City employee to increase creative space optimization and connect ACME to Rally Austin to nonprofits!\n\n\u2022 Restore CSAP. Creative Spaces can't grow to meet potential optimization without funding.\n\n\u2022 Thrive needs fixing yesterday to help arts group not experience funding gaps.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
