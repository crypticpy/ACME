  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1816\nResponse Text: Yes one of the biggest things I\u2019d encourage ACME to center is long-term trust-building and power-sharing with the artists, organizers, and cultural leaders who have already been doing this work for years often with little to no institutional support.\n\nA few key thoughts:\n1. Don\u2019t just fund art; fund ecosystems.\n\nSupport artist-led organizations, mutual aid networks, community venues, and informal collectives that already support artists behind the scenes. Sustainability happens when the whole web is strengthened, not just individual projects.\n\n2. Create feedback loops that matter.\n\nMake sure artists and cultural workers are involved after the survey stage on advisory boards, in selection committees, in co-designing programs, and in public accountability structures. Ask for feedback, and show how it\u2019s being used.\n\n3. Invest in the margins.\n\nPrioritize the communities most impacted by displacement, erasure, and underfunding especially BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, youth, and immigrant creatives. Equity isn\u2019t just a value it\u2019s a measurable outcome.\n\n4. Make it human.\n\nBe accessible, responsive, and people-first. Sometimes the most powerful support isn\u2019t money it\u2019s showing up, listening deeply, and making someone feel seen and valued in a system that often overlooks them.\n\nACME has a real opportunity to help redefine what public cultural support can look like not just as a gatekeeper of resources, but as a steward of collective care, shared power, and visionary imagination.\n\nThank you for asking these questions.
