  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1761\nResponse Text: This survey concerns me in that it seems to accept the faulty premises that have dominated the discussion about arts funding for years.  Where is the focus on public benefit?  If ACME works to insure a wide variety of cultural work and support systems exist, that will lead to a healthy ecosystem and decent jobs for artists.  Please move away from the idea that it is a public responsibility to foster emerging artists and reach every individual who thinks they are a creative.  While derided at \"gatekeeping,\" a healthy professional arts sector  is actually the most effective way to provide opportunities for emerging artists while strengthening cultural offerings for the general public AND keeping venues and production companies healthy.  Still, the very creation of ACME is a long needed good start.
