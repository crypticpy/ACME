  "prompt": "Question: What barriers do you or your community face in accessing support or services related to arts, culture, music and entertainment?\n\nResponse ID: resp_2812\nResponse Text: There aren\u2019t enough grants for projects that lie outside of the usual categories\u2014for example, I write screenplays, audio dramas, and TV scripts, but there is not enough support for writers. I also write, direct, and produce an audio drama, which is on Apple, Spotify, and other major podcasting platforms, and we use 26 Austin-based actors. We don\u2019t have the money to pay our actors or our production people very much, although we all put in a massive amount of time. Crowd funding is also time consuming\u2014and doesn\u2019t begin to cover all of our expenses. Plus, I have to market the whole thing myself. All of this is incredibly difficult and stressful, because I\u2019m also constantly looking for/doing gig or temp work to pay the bills. The higher the cost of living, the more stressful it gets. There are a lot of talented people here, but there isn\u2019t enough work for people to pay the bills.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
