  "prompt": "Question: What barriers do you or your community face in accessing support or services related to arts, culture, music and entertainment?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1089\nResponse Text: A huge barrier in accessing support and services related to the arts is the simple fact that very few people can afford to be artists in this community. Most artists and performers I know are forced to have day jobs to make ends meet. Between day jobs AND making art, there is very little time for artists to access programs that may be there. I think this is a big reason you see a disconnect between city staff HAVING services to help us and us actually being able to move them.
