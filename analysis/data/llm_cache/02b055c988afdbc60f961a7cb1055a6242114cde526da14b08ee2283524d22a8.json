I believe ACME should continue actively keeping the Cultural Arts Grant funding (ex: Live music fund, Elevate, Nexus, Thrive) going for artist/creatives/small business owners. This is the most helpful way to alleviate increasing costs of living and allow for Austin to thrive as a cultural arts city....\n3. like to see the city come out to the events with the Thrive and help them make there programs better support there mission....\n4. ACME\u2019s proposed changes, particularly the 50% match requirement threaten to undo the equity and access initiatives that have helped organizations led by and serving people of color thrive.\n\nAs Austin continues to lose Black and Brown residents to larger cities with more robust cultural offerings, th...\n5. The current programs are working well as they are. The proposed changes, including the 50% match requirement and limiting the ability to apply for Thrive after two cycles are deeply concerning. These changes seem to primarily benefit more privileged organizations, effectively shifting access to sign...\n6. What I\u2019d like to see isn\u2019t more programming from cultural producers\u2014we\u2019re already doing that, often with limited resources and little institutional support. What I want is for the City to step up and create the conditions that allow artists, organizers, and cultural workers to continue doing what th...\n7. Our program, Elevate, currently is a dumping ground for applicants who don't fit the \"priority\" Thrive, and to some degree, Nexus programs. In Elevate, non-profit organizations compete against for profit businesses and individual artists. These are not the same, having different goals, missions and ...\n8. \u2022 Find ways to have lived experience expressed narratively in the application (which can influence score among enlightened panelists/evaluators), but not as an exclusionary eligibility threshold as it was in the pilot.\n\n\u2022 Write new guidelines to obtain enlightened panelists WHO HAVE ARTS EXPERTISE i...\n9. The most prominent barrier we encounter is the systemic challenge of funding for our organization. Our grassroots projects, designed to amplify local artistic voices, frequently compete against well-resourced, larger organizations or we're not set up to thrive. This dynamic makes it difficult to sec...\n10. The funding programs for Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive should be reconsidered and redesigned, from my perspective.  They are no longer equitable and the changes that we have seen in the last 5 years have been detrimental to artists and arts organizations alike.  I my opinion, the department's attempts ...\n11. There can be some improvements made to the panel review process. It seems that a longer training may be needed for panelists and I like that the staff had planned to take the public review parts offline. However it would be nice to incorporate the ability to respond to 1-2 questions from the panelis...\n12. These programs need to focus on performance, music, bringing arts of all genre's to the community.  The prior emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion, rather than the art, does not insure that all types of performance will be available in Austin.  I understand that underrepresented artists do no...\n13. I am writing a list but please know I have so much respect and see so many AMAZING elements of the funding programs now. Some of the qualities in Thrive and Elevate especially are things private and public funders started doing after Austin rolled them out. No match, no budget restrictions, centerin...\n14. ACME could also help develop cooperative models for shared artist work and public facing spaces, where time, labor, and community investment are recognized as value. This would empower artists to build cultural hubs with long-term impact, rather than rely on gatekeeping, top-down models.\n\nEven bette...\n15. Art spaces need their own branch of funding opportunities, without art spaces artists have no place to work/showcase/gather. Artists need more than annual events to thrive in society, they need everyday spaces to work, showcase, and sell....\n16. Stop politicizing art and artists, ALL ARTISTS are at risk of displacement and are hugely underrepresented in this city, regardless of ethnicity/sex/gender. Art organizations are very much at risk too and are crucial to a healthy creative ecosystem. The local art scene requires more than a few big a...\n17. Thrive and elevate were created with the best intentions. However, they try to create inclusivity in the most exclusive way possible. Amplifying underserved voices must be done. And the city needs to protect the organizations that have made Austin a great place to live. Both can be true at the same ...\n18. Austin Texas Musicians has submitted to ACME detailed feedback to help improve the Live Music Fund. Per Cultural Arts grants, including Thrive, Elevate and Nexus, we'd like to see increased prioritization of arts orgs that have a proven and deep impact upon the community over orgs that have just sta...\n19. While our org was ineligible to serve on the initial ACME working group because we do want to participate in Thrive and Elevate grant programs, we feel this may be prohibitive in fully gathering community input from many industry stakeholders and professionals that serve the arts community. If there...\n20. ACME must evaluate the success and sustainability of the THRIVE program.  Many who have been awarded a grant feel abandoned and/or betrayed when that money is not renewed or available in year 3.  Yet the city can not support 35 groups every year at the $150,000 level forever. It is not possible.  Al...\n21. In my case Thrive\\Elevate did not follow its self imposed rules of accountability, and perception of hypocrisy.  If, the grant paperwork states that if there was a problem with the grant they would reach out for clarification.  Plus, the Thrive\\Elevate grants were determined using the same form subm...\n22. The community I consider myself part of, independent (self-employed) arts workers, primarily faces financial barriers, receiving fairly low wages relative to cost of living. We are part of the larger community of low-income people in Austin (which also have disproportionately high representation amo...\n23. I just want to stress how important I believe it is that the arts (of all types) continue to be funded in Austin, especially our existing organizations and infrastructure. I believe we are at a critical juncture, and now is the time to double down if we want to preserve the creative soul of our comm...\n24. Repeating what I said above, I believe Austin has a rich yoga culture. This culture is difficult to sustain post pandemic, and help would be welcomed so these communities can thrive and still continue to offer the cultural and musical programming to the surrounding neighborhoods....\n25. Repeating what I said above, Austin is rich in yoga culture. People think of Austin as one of the yoga capitals of the world. And this community needs help to continue to keep studios open and thrive....\n26. Some key barriers include:\nLack of Funding Access: Smaller or emerging artists often struggle to navigate complex grant processes or compete for limited resources.\nGatekeeping and Lack of Visibility: Opportunities often go to the same circles, making it hard for new or underrepresented voices to bre...\n27. We need Thrive level funding (or beyond), but it's very uncertain whether we'll be eligible for more of that funding without a gap. As we run a venue, that would be devastating for us. I would like to see more focus on the importance of the art and the communities we serve in the funding process. We...\n28. I find myself frustrated that more recently ACME has taken funding from a large number of groups and instead focused on giving larger amounts to specific cultural groups while overlooking others. For instance, removing funding from Trouble Puppet and Glass Half Full, which is female minority owned a...\n29. ACME has an opportunity to lead with humility and responsiveness by actively listening to both new and long-established voices. Public trust depends on transparent processes, culturally competent communication, and consistency in funding. ACME should also recognize that creative ecosystems thrive no...\n30. Strongly support performance venues (specifically venues that host theater and dance) who rent their space to smaller groups -- these are fast disappearing and it's a real crisis.  Help establish new venues  in areas where there are none--in unused warehouses, that kind of thing. Support venues who ...\n31. I was so excited when the Thrive grant was introduced to ensure that historically underrepresented artists were funded, and I've seen great work come from some of those grants. But I've also been baffled by some of the decisions: why was Zell Miller, with his decades of extraordinary work in arts ed...\n32. From what I've seen, this entire endeavor has been badly handled from day one.  Apparently the initial activities were very secretive and not accessible, especially to the artists and groups who were targeted.  Two excuses given re: conflicts of interest and open meetings were clearly not legal and ...\n33. I think we need to consider sustainablity. I am deeply concerned that we are hiring staff, building out spaces, and expanding programing that may ultimately have funding reduced or eliminated. While the improvements to access that have been made in these granting programs there is so much uncertaint...\n34. I'm really happy to see ACME starting with such a comprehensive attempt to listen to those organizations and leaders from its inception. One thing I really valued about the Elevate and Thrive programs was the emphasis on growing organizational capacity and trying to make arts orgs grow beyond a reli...\n35. I was an evaluator for Elevate and Thrive, and despite the best efforts of COA staff, I think there remained some confusion from applicants (esp. from organizations of color) about the purposes of the grant and the cultural specificity that was needed in their applications in order to get the highes...\n36. ACME should be in better communication and be a bit more transparent with nonprofit leaders about matters like the state of the arts and funding. The sentiment I've heard from arts & education nonprofits is that they don't know if there will be continued support for their organizations. Low support ...\n37. I believe ACME should be a more permanent partner with some of our city\u2019s cornerstone organizations. For example, Cine Las Americas. Our city\u2019s ONLY Latino/indigenous film festival. It requires funding and the idea of only allowing it to be given something like the thrive grant for so many years and...\n38. I don't think the City of Austin has done a very good job allocating funds to organizations that support the arts in general since Covid. It seems they have limited funds and opportunities to individuals or organization that the staff is favorable towards. Therefore, more and more organizations in t...\n39. I do not know how accessible it is but I do understand it is not working. Artists of all representations are leaving Austin in general for the same reason. Opportunities are limited, galleries are shutting down, and visual art is not as valued here as it is in larger cities. Who knows how long this ...\n40. Just funding the arts in the way that allowed Women and their Work, Big Medium, and many other artists and arts organizations to thrive as they did in the past. For some strange reason, that has ended. And it happened way before this horrible new Federal administration took office in 2025. If the CO...\n41. lack of city funding due to not being a person of color (only directed at the Nexus, Elevate, Thrive grant criteria). I served as a panelist on the Thrive/Elevate Grants and realized all funding was view through the lens of racial equity. I totally think everyone should get funding, no one left out....\n42. To improve the Nexus, Thrive, and Elevate grant programs, Austin should focus on transparency, accessibility, and long-term impact. These grants are vital tools for cultural equity but they need intentional refinement to truly meet the needs of our creative ecosystem. \n\nMany smaller organizations an...\n43. Promote ways these new business owners and creatives can thrive long-term. Such as financial coaching, lower cost of living opportunities, or paid gigs for people to grow their porfolio. I wasn't aware for that space assistance program, promote that better. Love the grants, keep that up!...\n44. The Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive grant programs don't provide adequate support for medium to large sized cultural organizations, which led my org having to seek alternate forms of funding which has proved unreliable....\n45. All aspects need improvement, starting with centering actual art in the questions and scoring, but also reinstating matching requirements and making grants proportional to budgets.  The idea that a nonprofit created solely to qualify for a Thrive grant, that has not developed audience and never prod...\n46. Austin has many assets and a pretty decent amount of arts funding compared to other cities.  The problem is that these resources have never been deployed strategically, with an eye on city wide, long term impact.  We need to take a big step back, and make a detailed long range comprehensive plan to ...\n47. Better differentiation between Thrive and Elevate (these should never be reviewed by the same panelists, even if there is a single application) and the scoring rubrics need better differentiation. Currently, organizations whose mission is to serve a broad audience as disadvantages structurally by th...\n48. Prospective audience not really understanding Afro Latin art (Caribbean art). Only understanding Latinx culture through what is currently known about Mexican performing arts. Fighting for visibility and recognition as Afro-Latin Artists. \n\nThe access to high standard training and performing arts. Th...\n49. More organizations getting funding overall rather than a handful of orgs receiving $150,000 and others (who have served austin for decades and provided jobs for artists) receiving zero support. \n\nSame with elevate: rather than some orgs receiving $80,000 and others receiving $0, it should be more eq...\n50. Please rework the Elevate and Thrive grants to focus on the arts and serve more people/organizations by spreading the funding out more. even though some of us are established artists and organizations, we are still very small and highly underfunded. \n\nAlso, a colleague of mine is an ASL translator w...\n\nAnalyze this feedback and provide structured insights about the program.\n\nReturn a JSON object with program analysis data.",
