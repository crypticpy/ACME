I believe ACME should continue actively keeping the Cultural Arts Grant funding (ex: Live music fund, Elevate, Nexus, Thrive) going for artist/creatives/small business owners. This is the most helpful way to alleviate increasing costs of living and allow for Austin to thrive as a cultural arts city....\n2. I wish there were more bridge opportunities at AIPP (projects with midrange budgets) I think nexus and elevate are actually great but I know a lot of legacy organizations are mad about them...\n3. If Austin hasn\u2019t resolved its cultural infrastructure crisis (surprise, we haven't) CSAP must return\u2014we still need foundational support for those providing space and services. Funding should focus *only* on events but alsoon sustaining the people and places that make year-round programming and event...\n4. Our program, Elevate, currently is a dumping ground for applicants who don't fit the \"priority\" Thrive, and to some degree, Nexus programs. In Elevate, non-profit organizations compete against for profit businesses and individual artists. These are not the same, having different goals, missions and ...\n5. The funding programs for Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive should be reconsidered and redesigned, from my perspective.  They are no longer equitable and the changes that we have seen in the last 5 years have been detrimental to artists and arts organizations alike.  I my opinion, the department's attempts ...\n6. More funding, more opportunties, bigger budgets (AIPP, NEXUS, Elevate)...\n7. The requirement to already have a venue or a booked exhibition for Nexus grants, rather than supporting the development of work by individual artists regardless of if there is a scheduled exhibition. That requires access to galleries and opportunities that an emerging artist might not have....\n8. These programs need to focus on performance, music, bringing arts of all genre's to the community.  The prior emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion, rather than the art, does not insure that all types of performance will be available in Austin.  I understand that underrepresented artists do no...\n9. Austin Texas Musicians has submitted to ACME detailed feedback to help improve the Live Music Fund. Per Cultural Arts grants, including Thrive, Elevate and Nexus, we'd like to see increased prioritization of arts orgs that have a proven and deep impact upon the community over orgs that have just sta...\n10. Grants for artists outside of music akin to NEXUS/City of Austin musician grants (which are a great step in the right direction! Please keep them going!). Larger-profile visiting authors; Jazz, experimental music performances...\n11. Grants for visual art shows, installations and murals without such narrow guidelines and haphazard grading systems like nexus....\n12. The length of time to fulfill the NEXUS. Artists are asked to \"dream big\" and present projects in a 6 month time frame....\n13. A better informed panel of reviewers.  Watching live the reviewers on cable access discuss my project was infuriating because they really misrepresented and/or misunderstood what our projects were about.  It showed me that the reviewing panel had biases and simply made up things about our applicatio...\n14. Transparency in grants and funding. The recent results of the NEXUS grant indicate that projects and applicants are unaware of the actual reasons for project rejections....\n15. Transparency in the process. The unrepresented community lacks knowledge. I attended an informative session on the Nexus grant in Spanish, and the presenter's lack of proficiency in Spanish was offensive to me. Transparency in the results: a chart with results doesn't provide an apparent reason to u...\n16. Nexus Grant Program \u2013 I\u2019d like to see applicants given more space to share details about their proposed projects. The current application feels limited in scope, which can make it difficult to communicate ambitious or interdisciplinary ideas effectively.\n\nCreative Space Assistance Program \u2013 This pro...\n17. More opportunities tailored towards historically discriminated communities, such as LGBTQ, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. communities, plus more effort in actually reaching those communities. More accessible grant opportunities such as the Nexus or Elevate grants. More financial support & sponsorships...\n18. These programs represent a meaningful step toward equity, but their accessibility for historically underrepresented artists and organizations remains mixed. On the positive side, grant programs like Nexus and Elevate are explicitly designed to support new, small, and culturally diverse applicants. H...\n19. I would like to see more space on applications (at least Nexus) to share the vision for the project. Also opening up funding--not just to arts organizations but to organizations that would be paying artists for a more interdisciplinary endeavor. Not such a silo-ing of art but seeing it as part of a ...\n20. Dealing with the unnecessary hurdles/steps for grant funding from the city has been awful. For example, with Nexus funding the city has not been timely in notifying applicants which has impacted their ability to even execute the projects that they applied for in the first place. Additionally, the ci...\n21. Nexus and Live Music Grant applications should not have points deducted if the applicants got the grant last year - that is a lame thing to deduct points because they actually know how to have a real event and effectively use the grant money?  Do you want to waste money on folks that dont know what ...\n22. The current AIPP budgets, particularly for murals, are unreasonably low given Austin's cost of living. The extended timelines and stratified payout schedules place an undue burden on artists, who often have to sacrifice other income opportunities to fulfill these commitments. This is unsustainable.\n...\n23. lack of city funding due to not being a person of color (only directed at the Nexus, Elevate, Thrive grant criteria). I served as a panelist on the Thrive/Elevate Grants and realized all funding was view through the lens of racial equity. I totally think everyone should get funding, no one left out....\n24. 1) Find ways to fund the arts besides HOT. 2) Individual artists or small orgs that don't have a permanent venue shouldn't be required to figure out how to market to tourists on the Nexus grant. As a well-travelled person who has been seeking out art and music around the world for decades, I can tel...\n25. Nexus grant seemed very particular in its demands and--as may be inevitable--ends up encouraging artists to craft work to suit the grant rather than the grant trying to meet artists where their work may be most vital....\n26. More funding for comedy and experimental theater and clearer guidelines for the applications. I am a professional grant writer and I have still struggled with the structure of the Nexus applications, so I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be for other artists who do not have a professional ...\n27. To improve the Nexus, Thrive, and Elevate grant programs, Austin should focus on transparency, accessibility, and long-term impact. These grants are vital tools for cultural equity but they need intentional refinement to truly meet the needs of our creative ecosystem. \n\nMany smaller organizations an...\n28. The Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive grant programs don't provide adequate support for medium to large sized cultural organizations, which led my org having to seek alternate forms of funding which has proved unreliable....\n29. Timelines for Nexus are VERY difficult in that you don't know if you have funding for an event until right before (depending on dates) which makes it impossible to plan. The cycle I planned to apply for was also skipped last year. I kept waiting for the app to open and it never did, and nothing was ...\n30. I would like to see more opportunities for giving artists money to do whatever they want to - the Nexus and Elevate are great but they make artist contained to serving certain populations and that can change what an artist can produce. Please give artists more affordable spaces - especially north Au...\n31. The changes to the Nexus wording and points is very disappointing. I would like ACME to really pay attention to how this deeply impacts the diversity of our creative community....\n32. Grants at various levels. This gives emerging artists an opportunity (such as Nexus) and more experienced artists strive for large projects. The more variety in grants would give more opportunities depending on experience....\n33. Clear guidelines for grant applications that do not create competition between Non-profit performance programming, individual artists, venues and commercial communities.  They should have their own unique guidelines and proof of past, successful programming. Nexus should be utilized for ALL start-up...\n34. We need more! More funding, more promotion - not everyone knows about the opportunities, more info sessions. Nexus info sessions were all full by the time I learned the grant had opened up again....\n35. Take time to do this right, but don't delay launching in August.  Either a bridge year of funding or only very slightly modified changes that can be quickly and easily incorporated for an August launch should be considered.  Or maybe a bridge year in August, a small program like Nexus a few months a...\n36. The thrive grants have helped smaller organizations thrive in terms of capacity building, paying Austin artists, and increasing the production value of cultural events. Would like to see the continuation of thrive, elevate and nexus...\n37. The Nexus and Elevate grants are a headache to document, particularly the close-out and making sure all the exact verbiage/logos are included in all promotions....\n38. Most artist/musician/actor will agree that there isn't a moment where you've now got the job that you can just do and stay at that pay level by default like in a regular job. You always have to make something new, promote yourself, do this dance of networking, while making room for day jobs and self...\n\nAnalyze this feedback and provide structured insights about the program.\n\nReturn a JSON object with program analysis data.",
