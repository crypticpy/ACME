  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1697\nResponse Text: Yes. Please explain why our entire funding system was overhauled just since COVID and now we are doing it again? While my organization didn't fare particularly well in this last overhaul, and this new process has a few glaring issues, I'm loathe to start from scratch and need a thorough explanation of what is happening.\nAnd while this overhaul is happening, are we going to be frozen at our current funding?\nI'm concerned we are going to pay another out-of-town consultant to advise us on our funding process and protocols.\nI'm opposed to using focus groups and advisory committees - whatever you are doing or hoping to do accomplish - the process must be as open and transparent as possible.\nSurveys like this one, which don't track who is responding or how many times they've responded aren't particularly scientific / useful.\nTypically when there have been town halls in the past, we have not received enough notice to attend them.
