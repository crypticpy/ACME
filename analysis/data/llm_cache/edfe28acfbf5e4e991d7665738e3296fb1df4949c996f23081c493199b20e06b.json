  "prompt": "Program: Cultural Arts Division\nTotal Mentions: 10\n\nSample Feedback:\n1. Honestly, threats to our funding like ACME's proposed changes to the CAD structure is our biggest concern right now. If Austin wants to be the progressive city that we claim to be, it would continue to support arts organizations amid the federal and state cuts to funding that are threatening our exi...\n2. Again, since the ACME team has not contacted me or my peers, I am unclear on what the Office is currently doing other than working to dismantle the current CAD funding system. I think it would be best to start with connecting with the community....\n3. These programs need to focus on performance, music, bringing arts of all genre's to the community.  The prior emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion, rather than the art, does not insure that all types of performance will be available in Austin.  I understand that underrepresented artists do no...\n4. This is hard work, I appreciate the core ACME staff (former CAD staff) so much. Thank you....\n5. Less rapid and unpredictable change of funding programs, better communication and transparency, listening to more of the creative community and trusting the experienced staff in CAD (the department that has the most extensive funding knowledge and experience of all the departments). \n\nSustainable an...\n6. The City, and the CAD staff have long been the biggest barrier.  They do not respect the professional arts sector, while showing clear bias toward those who suck up to them (umm, white boy hipster Zac Traeger's abuse of the system makes a mockery of \"equity\" while staff looks the other way).  They h...\n7. First of all, I champion, appreciate, and support all of the current cultural arts division staff and their tireless advocacy for Austin arts! Outside of them, in the rest of Austin programming, I see gatekeeping and bureaucracy. Many of us already running community-based projects face unnecessary a...\n8. I would like to express my deep concern regarding the review process and the panel members of the Cultural Funding Team at the City of Austin Economic Development Department (Cultural Arts Division). The current review process, as exemplified by the publicly available YouTube video that demonstrates...\n9. Based on the current budgetary policies of CAD grants like Elevate, organizations are actually discouraged to collaborate and share resources (financial capital, host collaborative events, etc.) in order to keep reporting and budgets \"clean.\" This is antithetical to the goals of fostering collaborat...\n10. Regarding the Cultural Arts HOT tax funding, administered by COA Cultural Arts division: In order for ACME to better support these organizations, ACME should address how the HOT tax is administered amongst all of Austin's arts organizations. The current system no longer directly addresses tourism fo...\n\nAnalyze this feedback and provide structured insights about the program.\n\nReturn a JSON object with program analysis data.",
