  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_534\nResponse Text: Firstly, More must be done to truly support underserved communities, particularly Black, Brown, Indigenous, Latinx/e/o, AANHPI, and LGBTQIA+ communities. Funding structures and programs often speak the language of equity but fail to live its practice. These initiatives must not merely serve communities; they must be shaped by them. That means: Centering the leadership and lived experience of those who have been historically excluded. Transferring real decision-making power to the people who are implementing and participating in these programs.\nDesigning funding and governance structures that are co-created with community members, not imposed upon them.\n\nProviding long-term, flexible, and relationship-based support, rather than extractive, short-term deliverables that benefit institutions more than communities. Equity cannot be achieved through top-down frameworks. What is needed is a commitment to redistribution of power, co-governance, and mutual accountability. Communities deserve not just a seat at the table, but the ability to build the table, set the agenda, and determine how resources are shared.\n\nAdditionally, please consider accessibility in everything, I've personally experienced the city drop the ball on this, with not following through on ADA, not following through with interpreters, not truly being mindful of how different bodies and minds may be impacted, or unable to participate. \n\nSecondly, the city is one of the largest employers in the city. There are hundreds of creatives who are working in different departments throughout, and are completely barred from participating in any of these funding opportunities. This means that the only people who can apply, are people who either work in the private sector, or live in another city. This feels out of step, as it creates a larger incentive for public art to be applied by people who live outside the city. As much as I believe in protecting conflict of interest, which I know is super important, I refuse to believe that there isn't another way to enable staff to apply their creative visions, or be eligible to support the cities creative programming without ensuring conflict of interest, beyond a general banning of all city staff from these opportunities. Just because I work for the library, means I can't help support pitch a mural in my neighborhood through a community driven praxis? As a city worker, an artist, and educator, I feel as if I'm being punished by being barred from these opportunities. Many staff within the city are vastly underpaid, trying to payback graduate degrees through public service, and to ban them from any creative opportunities offered by the city is not right. As city employees, we devote our lives to serve, and are often in public facing positions where we intentionally are building meaningful genuine relationships with the public.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
