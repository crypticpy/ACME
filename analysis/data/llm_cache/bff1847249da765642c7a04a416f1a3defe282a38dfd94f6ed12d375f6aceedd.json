I believe ACME should continue actively keeping the Cultural Arts Grant funding (ex: Live music fund, Elevate, Nexus, Thrive) going for artist/creatives/small business owners. This is the most helpful way to alleviate increasing costs of living and allow for Austin to thrive as a cultural arts city....\n2. I wish there were more bridge opportunities at AIPP (projects with midrange budgets) I think nexus and elevate are actually great but I know a lot of legacy organizations are mad about them...\n3. Our program, Elevate, currently is a dumping ground for applicants who don't fit the \"priority\" Thrive, and to some degree, Nexus programs. In Elevate, non-profit organizations compete against for profit businesses and individual artists. These are not the same, having different goals, missions and ...\n4. The most prominent barrier we encounter is the systemic challenge of funding for our organization. Our grassroots projects, designed to amplify local artistic voices, frequently compete against well-resourced, larger organizations or we're not set up to thrive. This dynamic makes it difficult to sec...\n5. The funding programs for Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive should be reconsidered and redesigned, from my perspective.  They are no longer equitable and the changes that we have seen in the last 5 years have been detrimental to artists and arts organizations alike.  I my opinion, the department's attempts ...\n6. More funding, more opportunties, bigger budgets (AIPP, NEXUS, Elevate)...\n7. A few months ago, I heard someone on KUT being interviewed after this most recent round (2024) of Austin Live Music Fund grants. They mentioned the disparity between the amount of money available (X dollars) and the amount of applications/money requested, which was something like 10X dollars (if it ...\n8. There can be some improvements made to the panel review process. It seems that a longer training may be needed for panelists and I like that the staff had planned to take the public review parts offline. However it would be nice to incorporate the ability to respond to 1-2 questions from the panelis...\n9. These programs need to focus on performance, music, bringing arts of all genre's to the community.  The prior emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion, rather than the art, does not insure that all types of performance will be available in Austin.  I understand that underrepresented artists do no...\n10. I am writing a list but please know I have so much respect and see so many AMAZING elements of the funding programs now. Some of the qualities in Thrive and Elevate especially are things private and public funders started doing after Austin rolled them out. No match, no budget restrictions, centerin...\n11. I\u2019d like to see more work that doesn\u2019t reinforce any particular narrative, but explores new ones\u2014projects that elevate sincerity, honesty, complexity, rationality, humor, and intellectual depth. We need space for experimental work that isn\u2019t defined by identity politics or social trauma, but by curi...\n12. Thrive and elevate were created with the best intentions. However, they try to create inclusivity in the most exclusive way possible. Amplifying underserved voices must be done. And the city needs to protect the organizations that have made Austin a great place to live. Both can be true at the same ...\n13. Austin Texas Musicians has submitted to ACME detailed feedback to help improve the Live Music Fund. Per Cultural Arts grants, including Thrive, Elevate and Nexus, we'd like to see increased prioritization of arts orgs that have a proven and deep impact upon the community over orgs that have just sta...\n14. While our org was ineligible to serve on the initial ACME working group because we do want to participate in Thrive and Elevate grant programs, we feel this may be prohibitive in fully gathering community input from many industry stakeholders and professionals that serve the arts community. If there...\n15. In my opinion, all the COA funding opportunities perpetuate seperation rather than inclusion. My dance company is a melting pot of cultures, and an LGBTQ+ friendly organization. My work/mission seeks to build bridges so that the people who support my work connect to our similarities rather than our ...\n16. ACME must evaluate the success and sustainability of the THRIVE program.  Many who have been awarded a grant feel abandoned and/or betrayed when that money is not renewed or available in year 3.  Yet the city can not support 35 groups every year at the $150,000 level forever. It is not possible.  Al...\n17. In my case Thrive\\Elevate did not follow its self imposed rules of accountability, and perception of hypocrisy.  If, the grant paperwork states that if there was a problem with the grant they would reach out for clarification.  Plus, the Thrive\\Elevate grants were determined using the same form subm...\n18. Keep funding the arts! We are honored to be recipients of the Elevate Grant the past two years. Our organization would not be what it is without the grant funding....\n19. Be more transparent in your communication to artists outside of the \"traditional\" (coded white) arts groups in Austin.  Language accessibility would also be key.  It's a shame that our art community isn't as diverse in funding as cities like Houston and Dallas that elevate voices.  The current fundi...\n20. More opportunities tailored towards historically discriminated communities, such as LGBTQ, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. communities, plus more effort in actually reaching those communities. More accessible grant opportunities such as the Nexus or Elevate grants. More financial support & sponsorships...\n21. I'm grateful to have received the Elevate grant for one of my campaigns in a past year, however, the process seemed quite loose and unstructured and use of grant funds requirements were not communicated to my organization in a timely or clear manner. A designated staff person or team to help folks w...\n22. These programs represent a meaningful step toward equity, but their accessibility for historically underrepresented artists and organizations remains mixed. On the positive side, grant programs like Nexus and Elevate are explicitly designed to support new, small, and culturally diverse applicants. H...\n23. I was so excited when the Thrive grant was introduced to ensure that historically underrepresented artists were funded, and I've seen great work come from some of those grants. But I've also been baffled by some of the decisions: why was Zell Miller, with his decades of extraordinary work in arts ed...\n24. From what I've seen, this entire endeavor has been badly handled from day one.  Apparently the initial activities were very secretive and not accessible, especially to the artists and groups who were targeted.  Two excuses given re: conflicts of interest and open meetings were clearly not legal and ...\n25. I'm really happy to see ACME starting with such a comprehensive attempt to listen to those organizations and leaders from its inception. One thing I really valued about the Elevate and Thrive programs was the emphasis on growing organizational capacity and trying to make arts orgs grow beyond a reli...\n26. I was an evaluator for Elevate and Thrive, and despite the best efforts of COA staff, I think there remained some confusion from applicants (esp. from organizations of color) about the purposes of the grant and the cultural specificity that was needed in their applications in order to get the highes...\n27. I think my feedback would be to maintain the level of fairness for grants that was there this year. \nI realize this is possibly swayed because we received the Elevate grant for this year, but the requirements were frankly quite simple and if an organization is legitimately concerned with amplifying ...\n28. The current AIPP budgets, particularly for murals, are unreasonably low given Austin's cost of living. The extended timelines and stratified payout schedules place an undue burden on artists, who often have to sacrifice other income opportunities to fulfill these commitments. This is unsustainable.\n...\n29. More modern marketing for these art events. No tickets for art gallery events. Keep them free and accessible to the public. There have been wonderful openings over the past couple years at the Carver that do this. Long form interviews, artist talks, conferences, and events that continue to elevate t...\n30. I would like to see ACME offer more programs that create immersive cultural experiences through art, music, and theatrical arts, particularly those that reflect the rich diversity of Austin\u2019s communities. There is a need for greater local visibility and platforms that amplify neighborhood-based crea...\n31. lack of city funding due to not being a person of color (only directed at the Nexus, Elevate, Thrive grant criteria). I served as a panelist on the Thrive/Elevate Grants and realized all funding was view through the lens of racial equity. I totally think everyone should get funding, no one left out....\n32. Many creative organizations have the vision but not the operational support to scale their impact. ACME could offer multi-year funding, mentorship, and infrastructure support that prioritizes equity and sustainability over one-time grants. This would give local leaders the freedom to innovate withou...\n33. To improve the Nexus, Thrive, and Elevate grant programs, Austin should focus on transparency, accessibility, and long-term impact. These grants are vital tools for cultural equity but they need intentional refinement to truly meet the needs of our creative ecosystem. \n\nMany smaller organizations an...\n34. I would like to see the programs opened to other arts organizations that, due to their very specific mission and expertise, can not really focus on serving specific underrepresented groups.   Also, I would like to see greatly improved applications (particularly for Elevate) that are more arts orient...\n35. Better assistance to organizations and artists in applying for grants.  Many years ago grant application workshops were offered that were very helpful.  I did not find that level of help when applying for Elevate and The Live Music Fund....\n36. The Nexus, Elevate, and Thrive grant programs don't provide adequate support for medium to large sized cultural organizations, which led my org having to seek alternate forms of funding which has proved unreliable....\n37. I would like to see more opportunities for giving artists money to do whatever they want to - the Nexus and Elevate are great but they make artist contained to serving certain populations and that can change what an artist can produce. Please give artists more affordable spaces - especially north Au...\n38. A clearer picture of the scoring rubric for the Heritage Preservation grants would be helpful. Simplified reporting and application process for both awards. Would like to see the Elevate funding have some criteria that is tied to the artistic impact of the project on the region. The Heritage Preserv...\n39. Better differentiation between Thrive and Elevate (these should never be reviewed by the same panelists, even if there is a single application) and the scoring rubrics need better differentiation. Currently, organizations whose mission is to serve a broad audience as disadvantages structurally by th...\n40. We would not be able to produce our season without the support from the Elevate Grant. We hope to continue being supported and hope other companies who provide high-quality, accessible arts experiences receive vital city funding as well. We hope that the funding is provided to organizations that are...\n41. Based on the current budgetary policies of CAD grants like Elevate, organizations are actually discouraged to collaborate and share resources (financial capital, host collaborative events, etc.) in order to keep reporting and budgets \"clean.\" This is antithetical to the goals of fostering collaborat...\n42. The Elevate grant program has been a game changer for the organization that I represent. We are young, now in our third year, and striving to reflect, give voice to, and invite communities that have been underrepresented in cultural spaces. Support through the Elevate program has made it possible fo...\n43. The Elevate program as it operated for the past two years was immensely impactful for my organization and our community....\n44. The inability to apply to Elevate again this year due to the change in funding cycle has been a big challenge for our organization....\n45. More organizations getting funding overall rather than a handful of orgs receiving $150,000 and others (who have served austin for decades and provided jobs for artists) receiving zero support. \n\nSame with elevate: rather than some orgs receiving $80,000 and others receiving $0, it should be more eq...\n46. Please rework the Elevate and Thrive grants to focus on the arts and serve more people/organizations by spreading the funding out more. even though some of us are established artists and organizations, we are still very small and highly underfunded. \n\nAlso, a colleague of mine is an ASL translator w...\n47. ACME can better support creative organizations by offering sustained funding, professional development, and access to strategic partnerships. Many grassroots groups are doing impactful work but need more infrastructure and visibility to grow. By removing barriers to funding, creating spaces for coll...\n48. More programs or opportunities for youth to be involved and elevate their work. More programs that amplify art and activism....\n49. The thrive grants have helped smaller organizations thrive in terms of capacity building, paying Austin artists, and increasing the production value of cultural events. Would like to see the continuation of thrive, elevate and nexus...\n50. Free and low-cost artmaking. Something like ATX Art Nights but more affordable (at least for what they offer). The Mosaic Workshop hosts monthly free workshops with the support from Elevate grant. More opportunities like that....\n\nAnalyze this feedback and provide structured insights about the program.\n\nReturn a JSON object with program analysis data.",
