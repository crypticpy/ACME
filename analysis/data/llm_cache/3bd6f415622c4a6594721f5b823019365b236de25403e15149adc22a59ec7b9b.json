  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_3266\nResponse Text: To ensure Austin's cultural funding programs truly serve the breadth of our creative community, the following improvements are a must:\n\u2022 Equitable and inclusive selection processes that reflect the diversity of Austin's cultural landscape. Funding should be more widely distributed across organizations of varying sizes, disciplines, and cultural backgrounds-especially those historically underfunded or excluded.\n\u2022 Transparent evaluation criteria and diverse review panels that include community voices and cultural practitioners.\n\u2022 Simplified and accessible application processes, with tiered requirements based on organizational capacity and experience.\n\u2022 Expanded outreach and education, including multilingual materials, neighborhood-based info sessions, and partnerships with trusted community organizations.\n\u2022 Flexible funding models, such as multi-year general operating support, rapid-response grants, and support for collaborative projects.\nIncreased investment in space access, including subsidized venues, rehearsal spaces, and long-term leases for cultural use.\n\u2022 Ongoing feedback loops that allow grantees and applicants to shape future program design and implementation.\nThese changes would help ensure that Austin's cultural funding ecosystem is not only more inclusive and equitable, but also more impactful and sustainable.\n\nExtract comprehensive
