These are the questions I would be asking if we\u2019re serious about building a sustainable, visionary future for arts and culture in Austin:\n\n-What would it take to activate vacant, city-owned properties as creative and community space?\n\n-How can we build meaningful cross-sector collaborations\u2014with housing, public health, transportation, and climate, and design funding pipelines that embed artists in those systems?\n\n-What could true community-led marketing look like, where artists and residents co-create visibility strategies that amplify the City, build trust, and uplift existing work?\n\n-How do we build funding and infrastructure that supports both one-time events and long-term, year-round cultural ecosystems?\n\n-What does unrestricted funding actually look like for organizations and how can we offer more of it?\n\n-What would it look like to embed artists inside City departments\u2014as cultural strategists or creative problem-solvers?\n\n-How could we build an \u201cartist-in-residence\u201d program for every major public initiative (e.g., housing, public health, transportation)?\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond
