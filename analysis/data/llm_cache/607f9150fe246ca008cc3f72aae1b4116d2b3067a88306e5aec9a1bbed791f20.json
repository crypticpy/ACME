  "prompt": "Question: What type of cultural arts or entertainment opportunities would you like to see more of in Austin?\n\nResponse ID: resp_278\nResponse Text: My tastes are varied and expansive. Right now, I'd just be happy to see the few that are still here across ALL disciplines shored up not just financially but in deed and voice at the City. Across all disciplines, our spaces are disappearing over night. The City has allowed developers to continually rip through communities decimating the places where once there was a thriving arts/culture presence. What good is more money and building if the things that are driving the growth in the City to disappear.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
