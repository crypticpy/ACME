  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1023\nResponse Text: I believe communication remains the biggest area for improvement. Focused attention on communications, alongside even more active outreach and engagement, are key to increasing accessibility for historically underrepresented populations in the local arts community:\n- More robust support to identify, engage, and train funding program panelists from and committed to serving desired constituencies\n- Even more active experiments in outreach to ensure that such desired constituencies are aware and apply, and are adequately informed and supported throughout the process (which could include the kind of collaboration asked about earlier, to engage  organizations/collectives/individuals already serving them\u2014those providing arts service who themselves are under-resourced and grassroots community workers)\n- Implementing a broader network of communication channels than currently used to share opportunities available for members of the arts community\n- While it's understandable to provide grantees with (mandatory) workshops provided by the tourism consultancy that the city uses, perhaps such sessions could be paired with others led by locals within the creative community with expertise in attracting our particular local public in Austin to arts events.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n
