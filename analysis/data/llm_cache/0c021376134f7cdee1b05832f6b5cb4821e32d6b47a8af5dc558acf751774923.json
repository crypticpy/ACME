  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1706\nResponse Text: ACME should support organizations and cultural leaders by balancing equity with sustainability. The rapid funding shift has destabilized long-standing groups that have long served diverse audiences. To avoid further harm, ACME should implement transitional support, such as bridge grants for groups facing sudden cuts and regular impact assessments to adjust funding strategies.\n\nA two-tiered funding model could serve both legacy institutions and emerging voices, preserving cultural continuity while promoting inclusion. Clearer communication is needed\u2014ACME must provide transparent criteria, timelines, and consistent processes to allow groups to plan effectively.\n\nBeyond grants, ACME should invest in capacity building\u2014offering training, mentorship, and operational support to help smaller or under-resourced organizations compete fairly. Funding should also prioritize collaborative projects that strengthen Austin\u2019s cultural ecosystem rather than just individual outputs.\n\nFinally, ACME should establish a feedback loop that includes artists and cultural leaders in decision-making. Without this, the system risks becoming top-down and disconnected from real community needs. Equity and legacy can coexist with thoughtful, inclusive planning.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
