  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_604\nResponse Text: I am writing a list but please know I have so much respect and see so many AMAZING elements of the funding programs now. Some of the qualities in Thrive and Elevate especially are things private and public funders started doing after Austin rolled them out. No match, no budget restrictions, centering community based orgs, representative leadership, and historical significance to marginalized communities was groundbreaking. The NEA ArtsHERE program was practically modeled after Thrive! That is pretty cool. My notes below are from 2 years of listening to folks and are things I have heard/observed. \n\nI am not sure the Long Center is very effective at managing the application and money distribution part. I have had a lot of conversations with individuals who found them unresponsive and unhelpful. This might not be their fault as I know and have deep respect for the Long Center, but something in that process seems broken. \n\nThe application portal should be more user friendly! User centered design at the forefront. If a large segment of the population finds an online portal confusing and keep making the same error, then it isn't \"human error\" it is bad design. \n\nPanel process and training needs quite a bit of refinement, more panelists with some kind of way to confirm commitment since sometimes it seems like some panels will have 5 people but other panels will have 3. \n\nThrive should all be the same panelists, having completely separate panel groups scoring for the same competitive grant is rife with discrepancies in scoring. Panelist training on equity (especially economic equity issues within Austin) and local conditions needs to be CENTRAL. I do NOT think panels should be live. The TCA's panels are not live but they do provide robust and constructive feedback for every application. \n\nInteresting idea for panels might be a prelim panel, then finalist panel that allows time for sending panelist questions to applicants and a week to respond before final scoring and award amounts are issued...just a thought. \n\nFiscal Sponsorship is a GREAT resource and should be optional but NOT required since we have no business telling artists they have to give a % of their own grant to another entity they would otherwise not work with. \n\nMatch requirements are not a good idea (especially since federal and state funding for the arts seems to be collapsing, how will anyone actually find a good match unless they are already a \"wealth\" connected organization). I oppose required matches but if the City requires them they should allow for 100% in-kind. \n\nEconomic mobility for emerging and low income artists and small/mid-sized orgs needs to be a focus everywhere for ACME, we are hemorrhaging local artists and community-led and focused small arts organizations (in any city these are the arts orgs that actually ensure everyone is seen and has access to the arts). \n\nAn idea someone mentioned to me that I will share: Elevate call for apps could maybe be before Thrive in the future, then Thrive is a supplemental funding application for additional operational and capacity support. That way it shifts community emphasis on Elevate as the broadest funding impact for orgs and artists...Thrive is like a bonus. Ex. If an org gets $75K in elevate then the Thrive panel awards them an additional $50K for operational/capacity building over 2 years? \n\nThrive cohort: A long term discussion on how the cohort as a model has worked and could be improved.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
