  "prompt": "Question: How do you believe ACME should better support organizations and cultural leaders?\n\nResponse ID: resp_713\nResponse Text: In my opinion, all the COA funding opportunities perpetuate seperation rather than inclusion. My dance company is a melting pot of cultures, and an LGBTQ+ friendly organization. My work/mission seeks to build bridges so that the people who support my work connect to our similarities rather than our differences. I have felt that in order to receive funding, I need to find a way to conform to existing standards that I feel are creating more of the same old issue. For example, in my company, we have 5 LGBTQ+ artists out of 10 total. We draw a large part of our audience from this community. In the last round of Elevate proposals, we were denied funding because they couldn't see specifics on how we serve this community. Which to me is proposterous. As an Artist I use my creative voice to bring people into their heart, to create a sense of wholeness and wellness. I refuse to tokenize members of the LGBTQ+ and their experience to get money. Also, as a puerto rican woman wanting to explore my own heritage but not become closed off to other cultures, I don't fit the bill of COA requirements either. I find lately I do not want to attend cultural events because they make me feel like an outsider since I have only just begun at 45 to explore my own culture. I have studied and immersed myself in many cultures looking for \"home\" and I still haven't found that. My art is not puerto rican, or gay. Its human. It comes directly from my soul.  And finally, my company was awarded the elevate grant in 2023-2024. We made immense growth and I was able to realize a potential i had only dreamed of, to which i am extremely grateful. When we did not receive funding for any of the opportunities available, it has actually created a situation where, while being lifted up temporaliy, we are now looking at a reality where I can't pay my dancers or myself ( who by the way are willing to work for free--even though they struggle to pay bills).  Our current collective financial situation is such that our community of supporters are tapped out financially, and i do not have connections to wealthy patrons. Dance is extremely under supported fiscally in comparison to the other art forms, and there are many dance artists vying for a very small pot. I appreciate the competition, but I feel that the way the system is designed, I have become discouraged and frustrated with the prospect of living my calling of being a choreographer who can support and grow not only my own craft, but the other artists I work and collaborate with each year. I believe that the burden of supporting arts and humanities should not fall on the backs of the people. They do t have resources to sustain events that can be upwards of 10k plus salaries. We are doing all we can to keep the company afloat, however our usual streams of financial support are drying up.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
