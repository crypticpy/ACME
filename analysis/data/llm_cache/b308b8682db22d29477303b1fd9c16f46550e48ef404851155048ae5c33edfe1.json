  "prompt": "Question: What kinds of programs or services would you like ACME to offer that currently do not exist or are underrepresented?\n\nResponse ID: resp_2856\nResponse Text: Courses, financial planning, very small grants for financial stability (similar to or partnered with the Plus One program), spaces for anyone to use such as theaters that a troupe/playwright/director can book for six weeks ending in a performance, cooperative practice spaces for musicians/studios for fine artists, film equipment for rent at a low cost or borrow and by the way fix your silly city website. This info isn't easy to come by. And for writers: some kind of short-term grant program so they can get something finished over a month or so.
