  "prompt": "Question: Do you have any additional ideas, concerns, or feedback you would like to share to help ACME better serve the public?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1101\nResponse Text: Start by listening \u2014 really listening \u2014 to the artists, organizers, and cultural workers who have been doing this work long before ACME existed. Don\u2019t assume alignment. Don\u2019t extract ideas or stories to justify top-down decisions. Build trust through direct relationships, transparent processes, and redistribution of power and resources.\n\nIf ACME wants to serve the public, it needs to be accountable to the public \u2014 especially those most impacted by displacement, erasure, and underinvestment. That means centering BIPOC, working-class, disabled, immigrant, and queer artists \u2014 not just checking boxes or putting them on panels.\n\nTrust what\u2019s already here. Fund what\u2019s already working.
