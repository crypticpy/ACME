  "prompt": "Question: What kinds of programs or services would you like ACME to offer that currently do not exist or are underrepresented?\n\nResponse ID: resp_2009\nResponse Text: I would like to see programs that align with an artist\u2019s growth and provide transparency on how city funds can contribute to generating additional income for self-sufficiency. Furthermore, I would like to see the expansion of available services. Additionally, I would like to see grants or funds allocated towards artists from various art forms, including music and performance art, rather than requiring artists to compete with each other for limited opportunities.
