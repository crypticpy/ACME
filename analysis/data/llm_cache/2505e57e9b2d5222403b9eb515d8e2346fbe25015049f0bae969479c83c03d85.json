Segovia St Austin, TX 78702 - this pavilion is  one of Austin's most important treasures yet today it is off limit. UNACCEPTABLE\n   3002 Guadalupe Street, Austin, TX 78705 - this building is meant to have a cultural use\n   411 Chicon Street, Austin, TX 78702 - the whole remaining half block needs to be an art campus.\n   1621 Nash Hernandez Senior Rd, Austin, TX 78702 - this building was meant to be a cultural site\n\nthere is nowhere to program in Austin. We don't have an oversupply of industrial buildings, therefor the city needs to step up.
