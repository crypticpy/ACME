Parking for musicians downtown, supporting struggling venues with some kind of tax break so they can pay musicians more $. I love seeing Art in public places! More opportunities for artists....\n2. Nexus Grant Program \u2013 I\u2019d like to see applicants given more space to share details about their proposed projects. The current application feels limited in scope, which can make it difficult to communicate ambitious or interdisciplinary ideas effectively.\n\nCreative Space Assistance Program \u2013 This pro...\n3.

Number one, I'm extremely underimpressed by your choices of art in public places. We need to be taking risks, making moves. We couldn't be any further off the map in the art world. We are nonexistent. Next time y'all make a board of people to decide how to spend your money: include artists! I can ha...\n8. quicker turn around times. Also give applicants a chance to resubmit their app. For instance, the stated reason i got rejected was for a question that I accidentally marked an answer that I didnt mean to.... It was a tiny oversight on my part and I wish I could have maybe wrote a paragraph explainin...\n\nAnalyze this feedback and provide structured insights about the program.\n\nReturn a JSON object with program analysis data.",
