  "prompt": "Question: What barriers do you or your community face in accessing support or services related to arts, culture, music and entertainment?\n\nResponse ID: resp_3492\nResponse Text: For me one of the primary barriers in access to community events is a lack of outreach before time, I often find out about events shortly before they take place. As a working person it can also be difficult to access events that take place during the weekday or early evening. Having events in the 6:30-9:30 timeframe would be helpful to me. Lastly, mitigating the spread of airborne illnesses by requiring masks and using air purifiers would also make events more accessible.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
