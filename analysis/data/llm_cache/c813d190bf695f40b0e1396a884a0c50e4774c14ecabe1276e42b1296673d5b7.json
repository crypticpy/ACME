  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1098\nResponse Text: More direct support for artist-led and community-rooted organizations \u2014 especially those already doing the work without being asked. Funding programs need to trust and invest in existing cultural leaders, not create new gatekeeping structures or redirect resources to outside consultants and institutions that aren\u2019t led by or accountable to Austin\u2019s creative communities.\n\nWe need transparent decision-making, streamlined application processes, and more multi-year or general operating support \u2014 not just project-based grants.
