  "prompt": "Question: What improvements would you like to see in these cultural funding programs?\n\nResponse ID: resp_1889\nResponse Text: 1)Begin with my comment above about diversified funding. Also use the full text of the HOT statute in creating the guidelines, which includes the use of funds for \u201c . . .  the encouragement, promotion, improvement, and application of the arts . . .\u201d The focus on tourists is detrimental to the community and has weakened our ecosystem. Allowing resources to be used to strengthen and grow a vibrant arts ecosystem (as was the case historically) will make Austin a place that attracts tourists.  \n\n2)The calendar change that's supposed to be happening this year is also highly detrimental. Most organizations have seasons that run fall through spring/summer. In order to plan fall programming, we have to know what our funding situation will be. For decades, we were told that funding had to follow the City's fiscal year. If it can be changed, I'd suggest July - August year, so orgs will know what their funding will be and be able to access funds earlier. \n\n3)I would also like to see the City do more to connect the arts community to the wider community and to encourage businesses/developers to do more to support us. Having a strong and vibrant arts scene is a draw for employees and visitors alike, which benefits us all.  Some businesses support the large orgs but have very little interest in supporting the larger community and arts ecosystem. \n\n4) We are not social service organizations. While the recent focus on equity and accessibility was much-needed, it has been disastrous in practice, leaving some of our leading artists and arts institutions of color completely unfunded. Please return to a focus on the work we do and the people we serve. There also seems to be very little accountability in the present system. I know of a grantee who received $150,000 to create and present 3 works of art, despite having no knowledge of the field or history of accomplishing that kind of work at any level. Accessibility should not be a free-for-all for anyone to receive funding. \n\n5) Return to discipline-specific and budget-level panels with more local representation and people who have some knowledge of the art form they are evaluating applications for. \n\n6) Commercial businesses should not be included in local arts funding, at least not in competition with non-profits. \n\n7) Do away with the third party administrator. The current situation is untenable. We spend our time being sent from the Long Center to the City and back again. There is not one place for all the information we need. We have to hunt through the City website, the Long Center website, Submittable (hate Submittiable), and often, information that should be easy to find is yet somewhere else.\n\nExtract comprehensive features following the schema.\n\nPlease respond with a valid JSON object that matches this schema:\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"SentimentType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of sentiment in survey responses.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"positive\",\n        \"negative\",\n        \"neutral\",\n        \"mixed\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"SentimentType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"StakeholderType\": {\n      \"description\": \"Types of stakeholders in the cultural funding ecosystem.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"artist\",\n        \"organization\",\n        \"resident\",\n        \"educator\",\n        \"business_owner\",\n        \"funder\",\n        \"venue_operator\",\n        \"unknown\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"StakeholderType\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"UrgencyLevel\": {\n      \"description\": \"Urgency levels for issues and feedback.\",\n      \"enum\": [\n        \"high\",\n        \"medium\",\n        \"low\"\n      ],\n      \"title\": \"UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"description\": \"Features extracted from a single survey response.\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"sentiment\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/SentimentType\",\n      \"description\": \"Overall sentiment of the response\"\n    },\n    \"sentiment_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in sentiment classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Sentiment Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"themes\": {\n      \"description\": \"Key themes identified in the response\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Themes\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"urgency\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UrgencyLevel\",\n      \"description\": \"Urgency level of issues raised\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_type\": {\n      \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/StakeholderType\",\n      \"description\": \"Type of stakeholder providing feedback\"\n    },\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\": {\n      \"description\": \"Confidence in stakeholder classification\",\n      \"maximum\": 1.0,\n      \"minimum\": 0.0,\n      \"title\": \"Stakeholder Confidence\",\n      \"type\": \"number\"\n    },\n    \"key_phrases\": {\n      \"description\": \"Important phrases that capture key ideas\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Key Phrases\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"intent\": {\n      \"description\": \"Primary intent of the response (e.g., problem_identification, solution_proposal)\",\n      \"title\": \"Intent\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\": {\n      \"description\": \"Whether response contains specific actionable items\",\n      \"title\": \"Contains Actionable Feedback\",\n      \"type\": \"boolean\"\n    },\n    \"mentioned_programs\": {\n      \"description\": \"Cultural programs mentioned by name\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Mentioned Programs\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"barriers_identified\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific barriers to access or participation\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Barriers Identified\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    },\n    \"solutions_proposed\": {\n      \"description\": \"Specific solutions or improvements suggested\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"title\": \"Solutions Proposed\",\n      \"type\": \"array\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"sentiment\",\n    \"sentiment_confidence\",\n    \"themes\",\n    \"urgency\",\n    \"stakeholder_type\",\n    \"stakeholder_confidence\",\n    \"key_phrases\",\n    \"intent\",\n    \"contains_actionable_feedback\"\n  ],\n  \"title\": \"ResponseFeatures\",\n  \"type\": \"object\"\n}",
