  "prompt": "Question: What kinds of programs or services would you like ACME to offer that currently do not exist or are underrepresented?\n\nResponse ID: resp_636\nResponse Text: I would like to see ACME offer programs specifically designed to support women artists at all stages of their careers. This could include grant funding, mentorship networks, residencies, and curated exhibitions that center women\u2019s perspectives. Additionally, services that help women navigate the business side of their creative practice such as legal, financial, and marketing support are critically needed. These programs should be inclusive, intersectional, and built in partnership with women in the local arts community to ensure they address real gaps in access and opportunity.
