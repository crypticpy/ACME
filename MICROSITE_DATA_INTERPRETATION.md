# Microsite Data Interpretation Guide

## Understanding the Numbers

### 1. Theme Percentages
- **What they show**: Distribution of all theme mentions across survey responses
- **What they DON'T show**: Percentage of respondents who mentioned each theme
- **Example**: "Increase Funding Awareness" at 39.9% means this theme represents 39.9% of all theme mentions, NOT that 39.9% of respondents mentioned it

### 2. Respondent Categories
- Total respondents: 1,187
- Many respondents identify with multiple categories:
  - 67.7% identify as creatives
  - 38.8% as organizational staff  
  - 54.0% as community members/patrons
- These add up to more than 100% because people wear multiple hats

### 3. Transportation Data
- **Accurate**: 62.3% of respondents (740 people) identified transportation/parking as a barrier
- **Context**: This makes it the 2nd most cited barrier after cost (65%)
- **Geographic variation**: Some neighborhoods face greater challenges than others

## Key Principles for Communication

### 1. Collaborative Tone
- This is a process improvement initiative, not a crisis response
- We're working WITH the community, not fixing a broken system
- Focus on opportunities for improvement

### 2. Inclusive Language
- "We heard from..." not "The community demands..."
- "Feedback themes" not "System failures"
- "Working together" not "Urgent action required"

### 3. Accurate Data Representation
- Always clarify what percentages represent
- Use "respondents" or "mentions" appropriately
- Provide context for all numbers

### 4. Professional Presentation
- Blue color scheme (not red/crisis colors)
- Constructive headings
- Focus on next steps and collaboration
